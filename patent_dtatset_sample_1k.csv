[Class 82 (ii)] Wire or band-like material to be annealed and coated with metal by dipping in a continuous process is passed through cooling means, situated between the annealing means and the coating bath, which can be adjusted according to the nature of the material and its rate of travel so that the material is cooled down to approximately the temperature of the molten metal. Oxidation of the material is prevented by passing it through a protective layer, such as salt or coke, which extends either continuously from the annealing means to the coating bath, or from the annealing means to the cooling means and from the cooling means to the coating bath. In the form shown in Fig. 1 a wire b passes through an annealing bath a of molten lead, any excess lead being removed by layers d e of fine coke, coal dust &c. into a protective layer of salt f. A vessel g contains cooling liquid such as soldering fluid or water and the wire passes into the cooling liquid under a roller h. Either the vessel g or the roller h is movable vertically so that the time of immersion of the wire may be varied. The wire then passes through a protective layer f <1>, e.g. of salt, and into the bath of molten metal i. The salt f forms a protective layer on the wire which acts as a flux and is not removed by the cooling liquid if soldering fluid is used ; if water is used the wire must be passed through a flux after leaving the cooling bath and before entering the coating bath. In the form shown in Fig. 2 the protective layer consists of a continuous layer of coke f divided transversely by partitions q, pipes p from which cooling fluid may be sprinkled being situated above the compartments formed by the partitions. The floor o on which the layer f rests slopes downward and is provided with apertures for the discharge of excess liquid. The wire passes either above the partitions q or through comb-like clearances therein, the degree of cooling being regulated by the number of pipes brought into use. A chimney k is provided for the escape of gases and vapours. The bath of molten metal, e.g. zinc, need not be heated except by the waste gases from the heating of the annealing means."

[Classes 6 (ii) and 58] In a cabinet for the germination of seeds and growth of seedlings comprising a number of groups of trays arranged at different levels and means for intermittently supplying a nutritive liquid to the uppermost group, a float chamber is arranged to receive the liquid after it has passed through a group of trays and, when a particular level is reached in the chamber, to allow the liquid to pass into the next lower group, so that the seeds in the trays are automatically subjected to the action of the liquid for a relatively short time. The cabinet is air tight and insulated. The seeds are spread on screens 19 in the trays 8 and the nutritive liquid is supplied through pipes 18. When the liquid rises in the float chamber 15 the float 20, acting through an adjustable stop, causes a counter-balanced lever 22 to swing back through the vertical position, thus moving a slotted sector 24 and bringing the end of the slot into engagement with a pin on a rod 25 controlling a valve 26. The valve being thus opened the liquid escapes rapidly until its level reaches the upper edge of a small inner chamber 27, when it flows more slowly. It passes through pipes 18a into the next lower group of trays, where the operation is repeated. The Specification as open to inspection under Sect. 91 states that carbon dioxide is admitted to the cabinet to increase the carbon dioxide content of the air therein. The air may be passed through the flame of a burner in a compartment in the cabinet, the products of combustion passing into the cabinet with the air. This subject-matter does-not appear in the Specification as accepted."

[Class 55 (i)] In a gas producer in which the air supply, with or without steam, and the gas withdrawal are effected in the neighbourhood of the gasefication zone, the former is introduced through a central pipe 12 and the latter removed through outlets 3 in the periphery of the shaft, so as to produce a relatively shallow gasefication zone of truncated conical form with symmetrical flow of the gases therethrough. The direction of gasefication is reversible by interchanging the air supply and gas withdrawal. In a modification of the process, the gas supply and withdrawal are effected at the same level so as to produce a disc-shaped gasefication zone. In the alternative method of working, steam from a heat-exchanger 15, supplied with feedwater from an annular tank 16 in the upper part of the shaft and heated by the evolved gases from the pipe 12, is supplied to an external ring-shaped pipe 6 provided with spaced nozzles 7 terminating in front of nozzle-shaped vertical air inlets 5, the gases thoroughly mixing in an annular channel 4 within the wall of the producer before issuing into the fuel bed through horizontal spaced nozzles 3 arranged below the narrowest section of the shaft. The wall of the producer is thus cooled. If the latter is unnecessary such as with a wall composed of sillimanite, the channel 4 and inlets 5 may be dispensed with. Air may also be mixed with the steam in the heat-exchanger through a valved inlet 19. The single offtake pipe 12 may be replaced by a number of concentrically arranged pipes, these pipes being provided with perforated hoods 13 to prevent removal of fuel particles.. In the reversed method of working, the steam supply pipes 18, 6 are removed and replaced by draw-off pipes for the gaseous products connected to the vertical channels 5. In a modified form of the producer, the cooling channels 4, 5 in the shaft wall are replaced by an air- or water-cooled jacket, and the steam admission nozzles 7 terminate horizontally in front of the horizontal air inlets 3, the latter being also cooled by the jacket through which they pass. The upper part of the jacket is of spiral form to increase the cooling air velocity."

Steam from a pipe 24 is supplied to an annular channel 8 surrounding the base of the shaft and issues through an adjustable aperture 7 where it mixes with the air supply through the gap 4. Both the gaps 4 and 7 are adjustable in width by movement of the spring plate 12 defining the aperture 7 and the independent slagcollecting chamber 6 relatively to each other, the spring plate and chamber 6 being interconnected by tension springs 13. In a modified form of the producer, the annular gap is replaced by a number of spaced openings surrounded by an air supply or gas withdrawal annular chamber of spiral form. In this modification, the perforated hood 16 of the central pipe 15 may be water or air-cooled; the water used may be admitted to the gasefication zone. When the air-steam mixture is supplied to this central pipe and the producer gases withdrawn at the periphery of the shaft, the air-steam mixture is controlled by a throttle valve in the pipe.

[Class 41] An electrolytic process of manufacture of alkali-metal chlorites comprises reaction between an alkali metal hydroxide and chlorous acid, the acid being obtained by cathodic reduction of chlorine dioxide and caused to react with the hydroxide in proximity to the cathode of the electrolyte cell where the chlorous acid has been formed. In modifications of the invention the reaction is between chlorine dioxide and an alkali-metal amalgam or an alkali-metal salt. In the arrangement shown in Fig. 1, sodium hydroxide is introduced into the anode compartment A and passed through a diaphragm D into the cathode compartment C to which chlorine dioxide is supplied through a cathode K in the form of a diffuser of graphite or other porous material. Oxygen is freed at the anode. In the arrangement shown in Fig. 3, an alkali metal amalgam is supplied to the bottom of a compartment A which is separated by a diaphragm D from a compartment C supplied with chlorine dioxide through a porous member K. This member is connected by a conductor E to the amalgam, the cell becoming a voltaic cell in which the amalgam is decomposed and alkali-metal chlorite is produced. In the arrangement shown in Fig. 5, the cathode solution is circulated by a pump M between the cathode compartment C of an electrolytic cell and a scrubber B on which the solution is saturated with chlorine dioxide. Brine enters the anode compartment A at the bottom and overflows at the top. Part of the catholyte is removed through a pipe P and the chlorine dioxide therein is separated from alkali-metal salts by known means, for example evaporation or crystallization. In the process described the catholyte may be supplied with hydrogen peroxide or acid to ensure that no chlorate is formed."

An open circuit, underwater breathing appliance has two-stage air pressure reduction, the second regulator being mounted on the face mask so as to be subject to the same pressure as the nose and mouth of the user. A mounting plate 1, Fig. 1, carries two air bottles 2 in stirrups 83, and their outlets are attached to a union member 6, from which air is passed to a primary regulator 6a and thence through a pipe 7 to the secondary regulator mounted on the face mask. The outlet 75, Fig. 9, from the air bottle 2 is secured to the connection member , 6 by a hand wheel 77 and air pressure then lifts a valve 47 for air to pass into the conduit 46 and thence through a check valve 43. This valve is spring-loaded and adjusted by a screw 44a and air passes through it to tube 41a and to a primary regulator. When an air bottle is near exhaustion the valve may be positively lifted off its seating by a pin 50 on a screw 49 or a by-pass to tube 8 may be opened by a manually-operated needle valve. The primary regulator comprises a valve 54, Fig. 8, controlled by a diaphragm 59, the outer face of which is exposed to ambient pressure and to the thrust of an adjustable spring 60.

In a system for controlling the temperature of an electric furnace supplied through at least one grid controlled gaseous discharge device, a D.C. error voltage is derived from a D.C. voltage indicative of furnace temperature and converted to an A.C. voltage wherein the phase and magnitude are indicative of the error, the A.C. being added to a further A.C. voltage to produce a phase modulated sine wave signal which is converted to time spaced voltage spikes for controlling the firing of the tube. The difference in voltage between a thermocouple 15, Fig. 2, in an induction furnace 13 from which it is desired to draw a germanium crystal and a thermocouple 17 in melting ice, is opposed by a battery 30 in a potentiometer 19-26 to produce a zero error signal input to chopper 31 at the predetermined temperature. The chopper output, after amplification and shaping in a unit 35 is applied with an alternating voltage from phase A to the two grids of a double-triode 36 having a common anode load 40, a phase difference of 90 degrees being achieved by a phase-shifting network 3 7 in the phase A supply. A sine wave signal is thus produced in line 42 the phase of which changes with crucible temperature and when applied to phase-shifting network 43 produces at the grids of ' thyratrons ' 51-53 which are normally negatively biased. Three spiked pulses at identical time positions with respect to the cycles of the three phases of the mains supply, the time position being determined by the signal phase so that the input power to the furnace and thus the furnace temperature is continuously controlled. A meter 125 is provided for the initial adjustment of the system and thermocouples of platinum and 90 per cent platinum, 10 per cent rhodium are stated to be most satisfactory. The system may be modified for any number of phases and for full-wave working. In a modification, Fig. 3, a self-balancing potentiometer 60 is introduced and the chopper and phase modulating valve 36 are replaced, between terminals 27, 28 and 58, 59, by a continuously variable phaseshifting circuit including a saturable reactor 72 the control winding of which is in the anode circuit of an amplifier valve 66. Improved sensitivity to sudden changes is provided by a resistor 67 and a condenser 68, and internal feed-back is produced by R.F. induction in a single turn pick-up 79 placed near the generator output coils. A stabilizing rate-of-change signal which is applied also to the grid of amplifier 66 is derived from a quartz rod 92 in heat transfer relation with the furnace, and a photo-electric cell 93 which detects the infrared emission therefrom. A cam programme arrangement, which utilizes a reversible motor to adjust the datum set by the potentiometer whereby the temperature may be controlled in conjunction with the withdrawal of the crystal is described with reference to Fig. 5 (not shown).

Void, [Published under Section 91 of the Act.] Thermometers; calorimeters. - A radiator system is connected with automatic recording- means for recording the number of heat units transmitted by the radiators. The radiators A, B, C, &c., which may be supplied from the same or separate sources of heat, have arranged on them hollow bodies Va, Vb, &c. containing air and connected to an arm L of a U-shaped tube, the other arm 5 of which is open to the atmosphere and contains a recording float 10. At the bottom of the U-tube is a chamber 3, which opens into a tube 2, the month of which opens beneath the surface of mercury in a chamber 1 and is adapted to be closed by a valve 9 operated by a float 7 in the air chamber 6 of the U-tube. The chamber 1 is connected by a tube d, with a closed water cistern W<1>, which can be filled by a pipe W<2> and emptied by a siphon W<3>. The float 10 is suspended by a cord 11. which is wound round a pulley 11 of a recording - device 17, the cord being counterweighted, and the recording-mechanism recording only the upstrokes of the float 10. To give warning after a certain quantity of heat has been registered, the recording device drives through gearing 20 a cam-disk 23, which is adapted after one revolution to operate a tumbler lever 25 and complete the circuit of an electric bell 41 or an annunciator 43. This device is automatically put out of action when the liquid in the arm 5 drops below the contact 48 as the cistern W<1> is being siphoned. The action of the apparatus is stated to be as follows:-The U-tube and the chamber W<1> being open to the atmosphere, water is turned on or the cistern starts filling, trapping air at its top and over the mercury in the cup 1, which is thus forced up the tube 2 into the U-tube, until the valve 9 closes, and the float 10 is arranged for this position to be just on the point of lifting and thus gives the zero reading, the same amount of air in the chamber 6 and tubes L being always entrapped. When the radiators are turned on, the air in the chambers Va &c. expands and transmits the pressure to the mercury and thus to the water cistern and varies the height in the water-supply pipe and also lifts the float 10, thus actuating the counter 17, which may be graduated to give the price of the heat radiated. As soon as the water reaches the level of the top of the siphon pipe, the cistern W<1> is emptied and the operation starts again.

64,544214,23655580,"18,673. Siemens Bros. & Co., [Siemens & Halske Akt.-Ges.]. Aug. 16. R÷ntgen-ray apparatus.-For obtaining instantaneous p h o t ographs by R÷ntgenrays, means are described by which, for a single exposure, the secondary voltage of a transformer energized by an alternating current is impressed on the tube for approximately the duration of a single period or less of the alternating current. To obtain the best effect, the primary circuit is closed at the moment when the e voltage through the supply mains is passing through zero value, and is opened again when the induction is at its maximum value. The means described are also adapted for kinematograph exposures. In one apparatus, the primary circuit includes a time-switch z, Fig. 1, which is closed by hand, and a rapidly rotated interrupter with a contact-segment s. The time-switch breaks the primary circuit within the interval of one complete revolution of the interrupter u, and by adjusting the segment s to the fraction of the interval during which the primary circuit is closed, the exposure can be made to correspond to a single period or less of the alternating- current cycle. A time-fuse s<1>, Fig. 3, may be substituted for the time-switch, and in order to complete the secondary circuit for any particular interval of and at any particular phase of the alternating current, a high-tension interrupter with contact-arms c', c<2> and contactsegments a<1>, a<2>, b<1>, b<2> may be used. These contact-segments may be adjustable in length and disposition. In lieu of an interrupter, a high-tension rectifier may be used, so that the discharge through the tube may be in the same direction during the whole period of the alternating current. For kinematograph exposures, a contact-apparatus, such as that shown in Fig. 3, is rotated synchronously with the alternating current and connects the secondary terminals of the transformer and the electrodes of the Rontgen-ray tube for a half-period and repeats this connexion with intervals of rest which are odd multiples of a half - period. Alternatively, the primary circuit of the transformer may be periodically closed for the duration of a period of the alternating current, by an arrangement such as that shown in Fig. 1, while by means of a synchronously rotating device, such as is shown in Fig. 3, or by a rectifier, the R÷ntgen-ray tube is energized in known manner, by current impulses from the same circuit, which are always in the same direction. The time-switch z can be adjusted to allow as many exposures as are required. In a device for closing the primary circuit at the zero or any phase of the primary current and for any interval, two insulated contactsegments i, j, Figs. 6 and 7, are relatively adjustable and are bridged by contact-brushes c mounted on a rotating arm a. The arm is loosely mounted on a shaft w and rotated by a spring f. In the position shown in Fig. 6, the arm a is held by the spring f against the armature c of an electro-magnet r carried on an arm t. This arm is adjusted by adjusting vertical arms which project through slots q in the cover p, and this also adjusts the position of other contacts x<1>, x<2>, y<1>, y<2>, which arc connected as shown in Fig. 7. On rotating the arm shaft w by the handle h, the arm d is rotated behind a spring catch k<2>, and the contact v makes contact with the contact y<2>, thereby closing the circuit containing the switch H and electro-magnet r. This action draws the armature c from the stop on the arm a, and contacts e rotate under the influence of the spring f. The brushes e complete the primary circuit for a period determined by the relative adjustment of the contacts i, j. The contact j is adjusted by gearing n. The movement of the arm a breaks the circuit through the electromagnet r, and the arm d has to be again rotated through 180 degrees to complete the circuit through the contacts y<1>, v, x<2>, u, and bringing the arm d behind the catch k<1>. A series of impulses can be obtained by continuously rotating the handle h, and the phase at which the primary circuit is completed is determined by the length of path travelled by the arm a rotating under the action of the spring f, and is adjusted by adjusting the position of the arm t relatively to the contacts i, j."

To increase still further the suddenness of the formation and extinction of the spark, the spark gap may be immersed in hydrogen-containing gases or vapours; or several spark gaps in series may be used: or again a part of the spark gap electrodes may be caused to rotate in synchronism with the E.M.F. of supply or may otherwise periodically be made to approach and' recede from the remaining electrodes."

Class 40(1) In rotating machinery such as lathes and slicing and winding machines in which the working diameter varies, the peripheral speed is maintained constant by a continuously variable gear which, is adjusted according to the difference between a voltage or frequency determined by the peripheral speed required and a voltage or frequency determined by the working diameter and the setting of the variable gear. As shown in Fig. 2, a lathe is driven through a continuously variable gear 15 which is adjusted by a motor 13 and controls the setting of a potentiometer Pn. The potentiometer output constitutes the input of a further potentiometer Pd which has its slider position controlled by the movement of the cross slide 1. The output of the latter potentiometer is applied through the winding of a polarised relay R in opposition to the potential at the slider of a potentiometer Pv which is preset according to the peripheral speed required. When the peripheral speed varies, an out of balance current pulls up the relay and the motor is started by switch 12 in such a direction as to restore balance by adjustment of Pn. In the arrangement, fine adjustment of speed is provided by a potentiometer 9. In a modification, Fig. 3, (not shown), a non-linear adjustable resistor of logarithmic or exponential characteristic may be connected directly between the sliders of Pv and Pn and be adjuster simultaneously with the latter potentiometer so that the sensitiveness of the speed regulation varies with the diameter of the work. A resistance may also be switched in across the tapped portion of Pd so that the peripheral speed varies according to the position of the cross-slide. In a further modification, Fig. 4 (not shown), the potentiometer Pd may have its polarity changed with respect to Pn by means of a changeover switch, for use in machining operations in which the movement of the crossslide is reversed. In an alternative arrangement, Fig. 5, variable transformers Tv, Td, Tn are used instead of D.C. potentiometers, a differential relay R being operated when one or more of the rotors 31, 32, 33 is displaced. Variable condensers may alternatively be used as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. In Fig. 6 a differential relay R is controlled by the push-pull output of valves 36, 37 provided with variable condensers Kd, Kn and Kv in their respective grid circuits. Frequency comparison is used in the embodiment shown in Fig. 7. A frequency which is determined by adjustment of a variable condenser Sv is produced at a valve 38 and is mixed in avalve 39 which oscillates at a frequency determined by variable condenser Sd. The resultant frequency is applied to relay R over oscillatory circuits 40, 41 and an amplifier 42. The two oscillatory circuits are off tuned and their respective resonant frequencies are determined by a variable condenser Sn. Balance is obtained when the resultant frequency falls midway between the resonant frequencies of the two oscillatory circuits. The arrangement may be used with turret lathes, Fig. 8, in which a drum 101 selectively connects different preset potentiometers Pv according to the peripheral speed required for a particular operation. In certain positions of the drum, constant angular speed of the work is obtained by disconnection of Pd at contacts 105. Instead of potentiometer Pn, use may be made of a generator Gn, Fig. 9, which is driven from the output side of the variable gear or from the work spindle and is connected directly across Pd."

Addition to 371,844. [Class 40 (i).] In a system of the type described in the parent Specification, in which a power circuit is represented on an indicator board in the form of a circuit diagram and in which the effect on the whole system of the movement of a switch is automatically indicated, when a particular unit on the indicator board is selected, a control circuit is simultaneously extended to the actual unit represented and a lamp is illuminated if the indicator and the controlled unit are not in agreement. If a remote unit should change its condition automatically, the relative indicator symbol is altered and an alarm lamp is lit. A unit cannot be controlled from the central station unless the indicator equipment is first altered to show the required indication so that the alarm lamp is illuminated. Selection of indicator unit. Assuming the switch symbol B010 of station 01, Fig. 5, is required, the operator operates key K3 and then dials on CD the number of the station and of the unit. The first 2 digits, 0 and 1, set the selector S1 to the first contact on its tenth level, 251 is operated over 155 and lamp 428 lights to indicate that station 01 has been selected. Relay 251 closes a chain circuit for 9 similar relays, each of which has contacts extending the circuits from S2 to 100 different leads. The outlets from 10 contacts on one level are shown in the drawing. 100 of such groups of relays may be accessible to wiper 127, the particular group selected depending on the position to which S1 is set. Selector S2 responds to the next two digits and wipers 227, 228,229 are set to the tenth contact in the ' B ' level. A circuit is thus completed over 227 and 234 for 321 which completes circuits for similar relays for the same purpose as described above for relay 251. The impulsing leads are extended to S3 and the last two digits, namely 1 and 0, step this selector to the tenth contact in the first level, completing a circuit over 154 and 363, from K4 to magnet 8010 which controls the notching relay relative to indication BO10. Checking selection. The key K4 is moved to the right and springs 131 connect interrupter 140 to magnet 8010. The cams controlled by the notching relay are moved rapidly through their various positions, changing the lamp signals behind B010 in rapid succession. The cams controlled by 8010 are not shown but they are similar to 51, 52 and 53. The operation of notching relays is described in the parent Specification. Selection and control of remote unit. When the operator is satisfied that the correct signal has been selected the key K4 is moved to the left, disconnecting the interrupter 140 and sending a single pulse over 154 to step 8010. If switch B010 is to be moved from the ' out ' to the ' in ' position the springs 130 are operated a sufficient number of times to move the cams into position 4 in which the green lamp 583 and the white alarm lamp 594 are illuminated. The apparatus is illustrated in this position. Key K5 is now operated completing a circuit for relay 507 to positive at 521, which enables relay 606 at the station 01 to energize over 652 and 657. Relay 606 completes a circuit for polarized relays 604 and 605 in series over line S and these relays enable magnets 603 and 608 to step wipers 651 .. 655 and 656 .. 660 respectively on to the next terminals. A circuit is now completed for 604 and 605 to energize in the opposite direction and the two switches are stepped forward step-by-step in synchronism. The contacts wiped by 655 are connected to battery through contacts of relays such as 507 and when contact 8 is reached 655 fails to find battery, as the circuit is broken at 516, and the switches stop. In this position a circuit is completed for 601 over line I, and either contacts 682 or 683 of the pallet switch PS, the direction of current flow depending on whether B010 is in or out. Relay 601 energizes and as the indication on the indicator board is a true presentation of the switch condition, its armature remains as shown. To close the oil switch the key K1 is operated and 602 energizes. Relay 602 completes a circuit for 611, the direction of flow being such that contacts 651 close and relay 612 pulls up. Relay 612 completes a circuit for solenoid 615 which closes the oil switch. The changing over of the oil switch reverses the direction of current flow over line I and 601 changes over its armature. Relay 505 releases breaking the circuits for the green lamp 583 and the white lamp 594. The signal is dark to indicate the switch is in. If the operator now wishes to trip the switch, key K4 is operated a sufficient number of times to move the notching relay cams to position 3. Alarm lamp 594 lights to indicate disagreement. Key K1 is then operated to energize 602 which completes a circuit over line C to energize 611 to make contact 653, whereupon the oil switch is tripped by 614. An indicator signal is returned to 601 as previously explained, relay 505 energizes to extinguish 594 and light green lamp 583. The release of key K5 allows 507 to de-energize and the distributer switches step on until their home positions are reached. The connections to the notching relays of associated apparatus are interwired so that indications of controlled apparatus change as the controlling switches are moved. This interconnection is described in the parent Specification. The selectors S2, S3 are released by the restoration of key K3 but S1 is held until K2 is operated. A number of indicators at station 01 can thus be reached with a single setting of S1. Automatic indication of change over. Should a switch such as BO10 at station 01 suddenly change its position, due, for example, to overload conditions, the relay 610 is de-energized and a circuit is completed over the pallet switch contacts for relay 607. Relay 607 closes a circuit, in parallel to that closed by 606, for relays 604 and 605 which step the distributer switches at the two stations. As no relay such as 607 is operated, a complete cycle is traversed. When the switches reach their eighth contacts a circuit is completed over I to cause relay 601 to change over. Relay 505 de-energizes, or energizes if it is already back, closing in either case a circuit for the alarm lamp and circuits to bring the indicator lamps into their correct condition to represent the new position of the switch. To extinguish the alarm lamp the operator must move the relative notching relay cams into the position indicative of the new position of the oil switch."

Vacuum tubes.-A photo-electric cell having a red-sensitive cathode according to the parent Specification, is filled with hydrogen. Constancy of the hydrogen filling may be ensured by providing a palladium tube in the cell. The support for the sensitive film is of a metal other than silver or platinum, and is preferably copper or zinc. A preliminary layer of silver, formed on the bottom of the cell, is washed, dried, and heated to 100‹ C. for 15 minutes. The cell is then supported with the silvered coating vertical and is filled with a coppering solution. A current of about 2 milliamperes per square centimetre is passed through the solution for 15 minutes, with a copper wire as anode and the silvered coating as cathode. The conditions should be adjusted so that the copper surface is a matt chocolate brown. The cell is washed, dried, and baked for a few minutes at 300‹ C. so as to oxidize the surface of the copper. The film of potassium is formed as described in the parent Specification, and hydrogen is admitted. The coppering solution is formed by preparing freshly precipitated copper carbonate by adding a solution of 400 grams of crystallized copper sulphate in 2 litres of water to a solution of 100 grams of anhydrous potassium carbonate in 1 litre of water. The mixed solution is allowed to stand for one hour and the precipitate is filtered off and washed. The precipitated copper carbonate is gradually added in excess to 60 grams of acid potassium tartrate dissolved in 1 litre of boiling water. The solution is filtered and allowed to stand for several days until the deposition of a blue precipitate ceases or becomes very slow. Specification 291,763 also is referred to."

[Also in Division G3] In a process for the non-combustible recovery of gases from the refining of pig iron by pure oxygen using a hood 2 at a predetermined distance above a converter 1, and a discharge pipe 5 for the collected gases wherein the draught is regulated to prevent air leaks and gas escapes at the hood, the temperature at at least one level in the lower part of the hood is measured to determine the position of the gas level, and the draught controlling means in the discharge pipe is operated so as to maintain the measured temperature within predetermined limits, and thus maintain the gas level at a substantially constant position. As shown, oxygen, possibly with pulverulent materials in suspension, is blown on to the pig iron 4 through a water-cooled lance 3, the resulting gases passing from the converter 1 into the hood 2, also water cooled, and through the discharge pipe 5 to a wet dust collector 6, and an exhauster fan 7 to a combustion chimney 8. Tubes 17 rising from points spaced around the lower part of the hood 2 are connected to a common suction pipe 18 and contain two inertia thermocouples 10a. The signals from the thermocouples are used to control a damper 9 in the discharge pipe, by means of a suitable control system (see Division G3) so that if the draught is insufficient, and the hot gases from the converter tend to impinge lower down in the hood and to spill into the atmosphere, the increased temperature at the thermocouples causes the damper to open, while excessive draught, which would tend to draw in ambient air and lead to combustion in the recovery system, causes lower thermocouple temperatures and hence, an increased blocking of the draught by the damper 9. To prevent spurious signals to the control system due to local heating caused by overflowing slag, thermocouples may be arranged to sense the temperatures at two levels in the hood, control being in response to one level only, except when the temperature difference between the two levels becomes zero, or of opposite sign to normal, in which case the control is blocked, e.g. by an electromagnet which cuts the damper 9 off from the control system and holds it in position. An alternative method of detecting gas leakage from the hood is to place flame-detecting means, such as thermocouples, round the outside of the lower portion of the hood 2, Fig. 1, not shown, so that when these detect a higher than normal temperature the damper 9 opening is increased. The signals from the thermocouples are summed, and control is only effected when the total e.m.f. rises above a predetermined value."

[Class 83 (iii)] Gears are finished by running the gear in mesh with a rotary gear-form cutter arranged on a non-parallel axis and having cutting edges formed in the sides of the teeth, feeding either the gear or the cutter in a plane parallel to the axis of the other and automatically inclining the axis of the gear or cutter with respect to the other in timed relation to the feed movement. The frame carries a swivel head 26 carrying a cutter 28 driven by a motor 29. The table 31 carrying the work-gear is movable vertically by a screw 32 operated either automatically or manually from a hand wheel 35. The worktable also carries a reversible electric motor which drives a screw 37 for reciprocating the work-gear carriage 38. The reversing-switch is actuated by lever mechanism 40, 44 from adjustable stops 42, 43 on the carriage. The carriage is provided with a platform which is pivoted on central trunnions 47 and is fitted with head and tail stocks between which the work arbor 53 is mounted. A roller 56 on the carriage engages in an adjustably inclined slot 57 in a member secured to the work table. Thus as the work carriage reciprocates, the inclined slot causes the work platform to rock on its trunnions and produces a crowning effect on the work-gear teeth as shown in Fig. 6 the crowning action being variable according to tho angular setting of the slot. The work-gear and tool-gear axes are mutually inclined at an angle between 3 and 30‹ by swivelling the head 26. At the end of each reciprocation or after a predetermined interval the table 31 is automatically elevated to feed the work to the cutter. In place of a standard involute tool gear indicated in dotted lines in Fig. 8 the profile of the tool gear may be modified as shown in full lines. In this way the work teeth are relieved at the top and the root in addition to having a crowned formation. In' a modification, in place of the oscillating platform, the carriage 65, Fig. 5, carries the head and tail socks and has a concave lower surface moving on a corresponding convex surface on the table. The preferred angular settings of the tool and gear axes for gears of various helical angles are given in the Specification. The motions for producing the tooth crowning may also be given to the tool-head instead of to the work-gear. Specification 415,875 is referred to. The Specification as open to inspection under Sect. 91 describes also a modification, Fig. 5 (Cancelled), in which the table is moved vertically at the ends of the carriage movement so as to remove more metal at'the tooth ends and give a crowning effect. In this form, dogs on the carriage actuate a switch lever 71 controlling a motor 70 driving the feed screw 32 so that the carriage is moved up near one end of its stroke. 'The reversing mechanism of the main motor then reverses the motor 70 which returns the table to normal position when the motor is stopped by a stop on the wheel 68. At the opposite end of the stroke the same cycle takes place. In another modification the raising and lowering of the table at the ends of the stroke may be effected mechanically. In a further modification a similar table movement is effected by gearing driven from the table feed screw which drives a cam acting through a lever to raise the entire table mechanism. In some cases the crowning effect may be obtained by modifying the tool gears without any other movement of the work-table than its rectilinear reciprocation. For this purpose the normal grooved cutter 101, Fig. 8 (Cancelled), is flanked by two other cutters 102, 103 of bevelled formation which engage the ends of the workgbar as it reciprocates and take an additional cut at the tooth ends to produce a crowning effect. In a modification, the side cutter portions 113, 114, Fig. 10 (Cancelled), may have the same diameter but different helical angle from the central portion. This produces relieved toothed portions which are on opposite sides at opposite ends of the work teeth. In a similar modification the outside cutting tools may be provided with cutting teeth on one side only, the opposite sides being plain and serving as guides. This subject-matter does' not appear in the Specification as accepted."

[Class 56] [Also in Group VIII] A method of forming fibres from siliceous material, especially glass, consists in flowing the material through small orifices in a container, drawing the stream mechanically to form fibres, and artificially cooling the streams with sufficient rapidity and intensity to harden the material close to the orifices. The glass flows from a furnace 10 through a metal bushing or thimble 12 provided with a series of fine nipples 13. The thimble is composed of a refractory metal which may be wetted by the molten glass, such as platinum or platinum alloys, and it is heated by the passage of an electric current to such a temperature that the glass is very fluid as it passes through the nipples 13. A blower 15, spaced below the nipples, directs a blast of air or steam on to the fibres into which the streams of glass are drawn by a rotating drum 26. The blast of gas, together with the air currents which are induced over the blower and downwards through the slot 17, cools the streams of glass and causes them to attenuate into fibres within a short distance of the nipples 13. Preferably the fibres are grouped into a single thread 27 by passing them through a guide or eye 25, and the thread may also pass through a reciprocating eye 27a to wind it uniformly on the drum 26. A brake 40a may be used to apply tension to the thread to allow, a higher speed of winding than usual. The fibres may be coated with a sizing such as oil, wax, rubber, resins, etc., either by a sprayer mounted close below the blower 15, or preferably by drawing them over a felt or pad 36 which is continually fed with the sizing-material, any excess material being removed from the thread by air jets 38 or a burner 38a. The size may be applied also by drawing the fibres 63, Fig. 7, over an orifice 56 in a receptacle 55 which is enclosed in a box 58 heated by an electric element 59. The fibres are grouped into a thread 64 and guided over the orifice by flanges 60. A receptacle 62 is provided to receive excess sizing-material."

Class 139 A device for timing and adjusting the frequency of vibration of a balance and hair spring regulating device intended for assembly in clockwork comprises means for suspending the regulating device at the free end of the hair spring for oscillation about its longitudinal axis with the lower end of the balance staff abutting against a support of non-magnetic material, means for subjecting the balance to a high frequency rotary magnetic field, and means for deriving electric impulses from the instantaneous amplitude of the balance vibrations and controlling thereby the frequency and the direction of rotation of said high frequency rotary magnetic field, comparing these impulses with those of a standard regulating device and adjusting the length of the hair spring until identity is obtained. The balance and hair spring assembly to be timed and adjusted is supported on a glass plate 14, Fig. 1; the balance staff being kept vertical by a bar magnet 15 excited by a coil 17 and the hair spring 1 being gripped between two separable rollers 3, 4. The roller 4 is connected through gearing to a servomotor 8. The assembly is kept in oscillation by a high frequency magnet system 19-22 controlled, as described later, and its period is compared with a standard, the motor 8 driving the roller 4 one way or the other to shorten or lengthen the hair spring as required. When the assembly is in agreement with the standard an electromagnet 13 is energized to operate a knife 10 and cut the hair spring. The end 24 of a screened electrical conductor 23 is located within the hair spring 1 and the conductor 23 is connected to the grid of a valve 31. An alternating voltage of 1000 cycles/sec. is applied through a conductor 26 to a ring 25 below the glass 14 so that an electrical field between the ring 25 and the probe 24 is generated. As a result of the radial expansion and contraction of the hair spring 1 an amplitudemodulated alternating voltage is applied to the grid of the valve 31. This voltage is then passed through the amplifier 34, Fig. 2, the demodulator 35, the filter 36, the low frequency amplifier 37, the limiter 38, the direct current amplifier 39 and then to differentiators 40, 40' from each of which is obtained peak voltage impulses. The arrangement is such that the impulses from the differentiators 40, 40<SP>1</SP> coincide with the passing of the balance through its midposition in opposite directions. The impulses from the differentiator 40<SP>1</SP> are sent to a time measuring device 42 wherein the time between successive impulses is compared with the period of a standard oscillation. The servomotor 8 is controlled by the device 42 to rotate in the appropriate direction for correcting the effective length of the hairspring and when the device 42 indicates identity between the balance unit being tested and the standard oscillation the electromagnet 13 is energized to operate the knife 10, Fig. 1, and cut the hair spring. The impulses from the differentiators are sent to unilateral trigger arrangements 43, 43<SP>1</SP>, Fig. 2, respectively from which rectangular impulses are sent to a modulating transmitting arrangement comprising pairs of interconnected modulators 44, 44<SP>1</SP> and 45, 45'. The modulators 44, 45' are fed directly by a high frequency oscillator 50, the modulators 44<SP>1</SP>, 45 being fed through a capacitive phase shifter 47 and an inductive phase shifter 46 respectively. The coils 19, 21 are connected to the secondary winding of transformer 48, the primary of which is connected to the output of modulators 45, 45'. The coils 20, 22 are connected to the secondary winding of a transformer 49 the primary of which is connected to the output of modulators 44<SP>1</SP>, 45. The arrangement is such that when the modulator 44 receives an impulse from the trigger arrangement 43 the coil pair 19, 21 is fed through the transformer 48 with a current in phase and the coil pair 20, 22 through the transformer with a capacitively phase shifted current and the resulting high frequency rotary field impulses the balance in its direction of swing. When the modulator 45 receives an impulse from the trigger arrangement 44 the coil pair 19, 21 is again fed with a current in phase through the transformer 48 and the coil pair 20, 22 through the transformer 49 with an inductively phase shifted current and the resulting high frequency rotary field impulses the balance as it moves in its other direction of swing.

[Also in Group XXIX] In a vehicle or similar drive system having a gas turbine 101 driving through an hydrodynamic gear including a turbo torque con. verter W in a low-speed range and one, two, three or more high-speed ranges introduced by fluid couplings, electro-magnetic or friction clutches or brakes, the characteristic of the torque converter is such that the gear can accept torques only below those which would result in thermal overloading of the gas turbine. Thus, in Fig. 2, the curve 30 is the torque-speed characteristic of the gas turbine. The input torque-speed characteristic of the torque converter is chosen as that curve 32 lying outside the shaded area 31 which is the operating range where thermal overloading of the gas turbine occurs. A torque converter characteristic, such as 34 passing through the area 31 is unsatisfactory. The intersection 33 of the curves 30, 32 represents the shift point from torque converter to the high-speed fixed-ratio range which then follows the curve 30. Three different gear arrangements for a gas-turbine locomotive are shown. In one, Fig. 4, the gas turbine 101 drives jointed axle-drive shafts 115 through a reduction gear 102, the hydrodynamic gear, and a reverse gear 114. The torque converter W has a reactor with a one-way detent 117, and its turbine 105 drives a low-speed stage 106 through a one-way clutch 109, which overruns when a friction clutch K, which may be inside the converter, is engaged to introduce a wholly mechanical high-speed stage 108. The driven wheels of the two stages 106, 108 also form input wheels of the reverse gear which includes an idler 111 and forward-reverse clutch 114. Fig. 1, not shown, has two high-speed stages introduced by filling separate fluid couplings and emptying the torque converter through two valves. Control may be automatic in response to output speed, torque or fuel supply setting. A combined converter and coupling may be used. In Fig. 5 the low-speed drive is torque-split by a planet gear having an input sun 202 driven by the gas turbine 201, a sun 206 on a final output shaft 211, and a planet carrier 205 attached to the impeller 208 of the torque converter W, the turbine 209 of which is connected to output 211 through a one-way clutch 210. The last-named overruns when a band brake 214 is applied to the planet carrier for wholly mechanical overdrive. The brake 214 is applied automatically in response to output speed by supplying fluid pressure to a brake-apply piston 224 from an output-driven pump 215 through a spring-loaded valve 221, which opens when the speed-responsive pump pressure reaches a predetermined value. Multiple converters and couplings in parallel may be used. Converters may be cut out by displacement of their turbines."

[Also in Group XXXIX] In an automatic tap-changing system for regulating the voltage of an A.C. supply, in which response to transient fluctuations is eliminated by introducing a time delay, the delay is effected by an auto-self-excited bridge rectifying transductor with a long timeconstant circuit to energize a control winding. The transformer tap changer 2 is actuated by a reversible motor 47 controlled by relays 41, 43. Relay 41 is energized via a time delay transductor MA1 when a lower limit voltagesensing relay 9 drops out and connects a signal voltage of one polarity from rectifier 21 to the control windings of the transductor, and relay 43 is similarly energized via a time delay transductor MA2 from a signal voltage source 25 of opposite polarity by an upper limit relay 13. A no-volt relay 11 normally maintains contacts 19 closed. The transductor MA1 is biased by a winding BW1 to provide minimum output in the absence of a signal on at least two other control windings. The control signal voltage from 21 is applied directly to one control winding AC1 to prepare the transductor for conduction. The signal also charges a capacitor 91 through a resistor 33 until after the desired delay a neon tube 93 conducts and momentarily energizes a second control winding MC1. The combined effect of the two windings MC1, AC1 saturates the transductor which, due to selfsaturation and positive feed-back winding PF1 conducts heavily to energize the relay 41. The feed-back winding PF1 also serves to maintain conduction in the absence of a continuing signal in winding MC1. As the tap changer operates, a cam 61 opens contacts 55 to de-energize winding AC1 and so render the transductor again non-conducting, and closes contacts 57 to discharge capacitor 91. The motor then continues to run under undisclosed control to complete the tap change cycle and also reset contacts 55, 57 ready for the next cycle of operation. The operation of transductor MA2 is identical in respect of control signals of opposite polarity."

138,1187498,42617446,"The invention concerns a method of treating a pyrogas before gas separation. The proposed method ensures highly economical operation owing to the low energy requirements for compressing the pyrogas and low consumption of cooling water. This results from the relatively low pyrogas temperature and low pressure losses during the multistage compression, which in turn results from the organisation of the processes of cooling, by contact heat exchange between the pyrogas, flushing water and an operating fluid, cooling these components with an external medium in refrigeration units and with a cold carrier in the evaporators of absorption machines, and by preliminary cooling of the flushing water in the generators of these machines. The proposed method of obtaining industrial low temperatures in a vapour compression refrigeration machine is characterised by a high refrigeration coefficient and low consumption of cooling water. This is made possible by the transfer of the heat of condensation of the refrigerant to the atmospheric air and by supercooling the liquid refrigerant before the expansion processes using an absorption refrigeration machine and exploiting the heat carried away from the pyrogas by the flushing water in the column."

248,1341169,17198305,"A technique for decreasing the effective gain of a bipolar phototransistor at high light levels makes the image usable over a greatly extended range of illumination conditions. The effective current gain at high light levels is reduced by fabricating a 'non-ideal' emitter, such as by inserting a thin 20 ANGSTROM tunnel oxide between the emitter and base junction. The tunnel oxide between the emitter and base serves as a variable resistor as well as a good junction for carrier injection from the emitter. The total base voltage is the sum of the oxide voltage and the intrinsic base voltage. At high image intensity, the bipolar phototransistor will gradually enter into the saturation mode, i.e., the base to collector junction is forward biased. The beta is thus reduced. The bias of the collector should be about 0.3 - 0.8V higher than the emitter at the 20 ANGSTROM tunnel oxide thickness for optimum operation."

Soldering; welding; thermo-aluminic processes.-The ends of rails, girders, or other iron and steel structures are united by a layer of carbon-free metal such as copper, silver, nickel, or alloys thereof, such as bronze or of copper-plated or nickel-plated iron sheets instead of ordinary sheet metal, as described in Specification 18,328/99, the work and intermediate layer being heated, and the work being immovably fixed so that the pressure to effect the weld is produced by the expansion of the work. The welding may be effected by the alumino-thermic process in which aluminium or calcium-silicon, silicon-magnesium, aluminiumcalcium, &c. may be used, or by the use of hot gases blown through a mould surrounding the joint, or by electric heaters of the resistance type. The alumino-thermic processes may be carried out in either of two known manners. In one process the resulting molten slag and iron is poured over the rim of the crucible into the mould so as to obtain a thin layer of slag on the work and thus prevent the molten iron from coming into contact with the work and thus to obtain a uniform union over the whole cross-sectional area. In the second process, molten metal is run out of the bottom of the crucible into the lower part of the mould to form a fusion weld at the foot of the rail, the intermediate metal being inserted only between the head and web portions, and being heated by the slag. The ends of the rails are mechanically cleaned and evenly dressed before inserting the intermediate metal so as to ensure a good contact. The parts may be butt-welded or lap-welded, the parts having bevelled ends or being provided with male and female joints, or with scarf joints, for example where half the thickness of each is removed ; in this latter case the longitudinal faces may also be joined."

Lathes. - In a lathe for backing-off reamers, taps, and other metal-working cutters &c., the tool-slide carrier 54 is pivotally mounted on the saddle 55, so that the slide 53 can be set at any desired angle, and the slide 53 is given a backing- off movement of variable frequency and amplitude through positively-driven cam and lever devices actuated by gearing from the main shaft 12 independently of the lathe spindle. The slide 53 has. also hand or automatic feed mechanism with automatic stopping-devices to determine the depth of cut, the operating-means for the slide 53 being, in both cases, unaffected in their operation by its angular position. Means carrying the tailstock 3, for driving and mounting the lathe spindle 1, for operating a collet 50 to clamp the work, and also a stop 51 to position the work, are provided. Framing.-In order to mount the tailstock 3 so as to clear the tool slide and yet be close up to the work, it is carried by an overhead bar 27, preferably of triangular cross-section and with recessed sides, carried at one end by a removable bracket 31 adjustable on the bed 1, and at the other end by detachable supports 28 on the headstock 4. Tailstocks.-The tailstock 3 may be constructed in two parts 36, 37, clamped on to the bar 27 by bolts 38, 40, and having a clamping-bolt 45 to hold the sleeve 41 in its adjusted position. Headstocks; driving machine spindle.-The lathe spindle 1 is driven by high or low speed worm gear 10, 11 driven from the shaft 12 and coupled to the spindle 1 through a sliding clutch member 21 actuated by a hand-lever with spring- controlled locking-pin. Feed-motions, tool and saddle; reversing- mechanism.-The backing-off motion is given to the slide 53 through a bell-crank lever 54 pivoted on a stud 59 and having a roller 67 on one arm 60 engaging the cam 61 mounted on a pin 63 concentric with the axis about which the slide-carrier 54 is adjustable, and driven through worm gearing 65, a shaft 66, bevel-gear 81, and change-speed gear 90 &c. from the shaft 12. The other arm of the lever 54 is in two parts slidably connected, the part 69 being set by an adjusting-screw 73 in such position that segmental projections 70 on the part 69, engaging a transverse recess 71 in a slidipg member 68 on the slide 53, are sufficiently eccentric to the stud 59 to impart the desired amount of backing-off movement to the tool-slide 53. An adjustable spring 76 assists the cam 61 in giving the slide 53 a sharp return motion. The automatic feed for the slide 53 to feed the tool against the work for the requisite depth of cut, may comprise a screw 118 slidably coupled to a shaft 120 having spring-controlled frictional driving-connexion with a worm-wheel 123, worm 124, and shaft 126. This shaft may be operated by the hand-wheel 153 through screw gear, or automatically by ratchet mechanism operated through oscillating toothed gears 139, 138, toothed ring 137, gears 140, 143, and shaft 144, on which is a pinion 145 engaging a rack-bar 147 adjustably coupled to a cam-operated lever 149, to impart to the tool the desired rate of feed. In an alternative arrangement, the shaft 126 is actuated by a ratchet operated through a sliding bar engaging the backing-off lever 69. An adjustable stop 157, mounted on the disk 125, forms part of the spring- controlled frictional drive, and the feed is thus stopped. A handle 161 may operate a cam shaft to put the ratchet drive out of engagement, and simultaneously retract a stop-bar 159, thus allowing the hand-wheel 153 to operate the slide freely in either direction. The saddle 55 may be moved by rack-and-pinion actuated by hand-wheel 97 or by a lead-screw 98 driven by change-speed and reversing gearing of ordinary type put into or out of action by hand-lever 104. Gauging-devices. - A stop-bar 51 is adjustably clamped in position to determine the position of the work in the jaws of the collet 50. Chucks.-The collet 50 is opened and closed by the screwed engagement between the collet 50 and the tubular member 48 rotated by hand-wheel 49."

[Classes 83 (ii) and 83 (iv)] In corrugating plain metal tubing, particularly for flexible bellows tube, each corrugation is formed separately in two steps by first displacing radially, by pressure exerted uniformly circumferentially of the tube, a substantially annular section of the tube to form the beginning of the corrugation and immediately thereafter and prior to axial shifting of the tube continuing the formation of the corrugation by relative axial movement towards each other of the sides of the radially displaced section, after which the tube is moved axially through a predetermined distance and the process repeated. The tube 60 is held by a pair of grooved jaws 11, 12 closed by levers 43 operated by cams on a shaft connected by spur and bevel gear to the driving shaft 17. The rear grooved edge of the jaws cooperates with the front grooved edge of a die 13 to form the corrugation. The die 13 is reciprocated through toggles 27, 28, links 26 adjustable on slotted arms 24, and cams 22 on a shaft 21 connected by spur gear to the main shaft. The die co-operates also with an inner member 14 which comprises a metal sleeve 57, a rubber sleeve 71, a metal washer 72, a rubber washer 73 and a second metal washer 74 all loosely mounted on a control shaft 15 and held thereon by a washer 75 and nut 76. The sleeve 57 is operated by a lever 54 through a cam 52 on a shaft 51 geared to the shaft 36, and the shaft 15 is operated by a lever 58 from a cam 53 on the shaft 51. The die 13 contains a rubber sleeve 69 which co-operates with the sleeve 71 to feed the tube forwards. When the tube is held by the jaws 11, 12, Fig. 11, the die 13 and member 14 are moved forwards together. The sleeve 57 moves forward relatively to the shaft 15 and the sleeve 71 is expanded so as to push the rear of the tube forwards and the sleeve 73 is expanded so as to initiate the formation of a corrugation 81. Then the shaft 15 is moved forward so that the sleeves 71, 73 are released from the tube and the corrugation is completed by movement of the die 13, Fig. 13, the parts 14, 15 moving forward at the same time. The parts 14, 15 are then retracted and the die 13 then retracted.

[Class 83 (iii)] A single spindle automatic lathe having an indexible turret carrying longitudinally movable tool-slides, actuated successively by a common control member and having lateral tool-holders carried by a transverse slide and a longitudinal slide and radial tool-holders each carried by a transverse slide, each slide being actuated by a separate control member, is characterized in that the control members are each connected by a separate connecting device to a source of energy, an impulse-emitting device causing each connecting device to be moved into the operative position at desired moments, but means being provided to prevent this while the slide to be actuated is out of its starting position. The tool-carrying turret R for a single spindle automatic lathe carries tool-slides C which are adapted to be moved by auxiliary slides 1 which in turn are fed by a projecting pin on a long nut 3 engaging in a rotatably-adjustable straight cam-slot in a plate 2 attached to the slide 1. Only the tool-slide in the operative position is engaged by the pin on the nut 3 which is moved by a lead screw VR. This lead screw is driven through a spring clutch AR adapted to slip on overload, a reversing drive 13-15 controlled by a clutch SR, and a high and low speed drive selected by clutches GR, PR from a change-speed gear-box BR. The latter is driven by an independent self-contained electric motor M. The clutches are operated by electromagnets S1, G1, P1, and returned to normal by springs 11, 12. The electromagnet circuits are also conditioned by switches operated by the tool slides and stops 4, 5 on the nut to give the following cycle starting from the initial retracted position of the tool slide, with lead screw stationary: (1) on operation of a switch such as R1 on the control distributer drum O-high-speed traverse of tool up to the work; (2) slow-speed feed motion; (3) reverse; (4) high-speed return to start; (5) conditioning of control circuits so that lead screw will be started for a new cycle when the distributor O actuates R1 &c. again. In the event of the safety clutch AR operating, this is arranged to throw out the main switch to the driving-motor M and also to operate a warning signal such as KL, indicating that part of the circuit which has caused the feed stoppage. Similar feed-cycle arrangements are provided for the members of a compound slide L, LT, and a cutting off slide F. An auxiliary feed-shaft V is provided for the stock-feeding and chuck-operating drives, controlled by an electromagnet D and a onerevolution cam drive. The circuit for this electromagnet is coupled with that for the cutting-off slide so that these always operate in proper timed relation. A modification using cam-shafts and all-mechanical clutching devices is described. Specifications 595,974, [Group XXIV], 598,082 and 626,617 are referred to."

The said members 16 are held by means of an elastic, annular member 17 between the lower, frusto-conical end of the inner tube 6 and a frusto-conical member 15 fixed on a tubular member 12 which is rigidly connected to a further tube 8, the two tubes 8, 12 being slidable along a fixed rod 20, and normally being urged upwards by a spring 14. Thus normally, as a result of the action of the spring 14, the members 16 are compressed between the lower end 7 of the tube 6 and the member 15, and are therefore urged outwardly to firmly engage the grooved outer tube 3. In order to release the fastening and adjust the relative positions of the two tubes 3, 6, the tubes 8, 12 are forced downwardly by raising the lever 10, thus lowering the member 15 relative to the lower end 7 of the inner tube 6 and enabling the members 16 to contract away from the outer tube 3, under the action of the elastic member 17."

[Also in Division B5] Pieces of material are ultrasonically bonded by heating an ultrasonic vibratory horn 11 to a predetermined temperature, arresting the application of heat to the horn and thereupon vibrating this horn at an ultrasonic frequency to transmit vibratory energy to the pieces to bond them together, the vibratory motion of the horn 11 tending to produce additional heating thereof, and cooling the horn as it vibrates to maintain the horn at a controlled temperature during the application of vibratory energy to the pieces. The horn 11 comprises a tapered exponential horn flared at its upper end to provide at an antinode, a surface 14 which faces a surface 15 on an anvil 12. Small protrusions may be formed on the surfaces 14, 15 to form discrete bonded areas. A disc-like transducer 20, preferably comprising a piezo-electric crystal coated with silver on its opposed faces, is secured to the horn 11, e.g. by an epoxy resin cement containing silver granules. Alternatively, a magneto-strictive transducer may be used. The horn 11 is supported at a node by three screws 24 provided on a plate 23, see also Fig. 3 (not shown). A blower unit 40 controls the temperature of the horn 11 and includes a conduit 45 having the discharge end thereof positioned adjacent the horn 11. A heating element 50 is situated in the conduit 45. Apertures (48), Fig. 2 (not shown), are provided on a side panel 39 to allow free circulation of air across the horn 11. Prior to bonding, the apparatus is adjusted to form an appropriate gap between the horn 11 and the anvil 12. A coarse adjustment is first effected by releasing locking members 93, Figs. 1 and 2 (the latter not shown), which mount the anvil 12 on a standard (43) by an arm (91) on a bracket assembly 90. The arm (91) is slid vertically on the standard (43) to move a rack (95), a C-shaped head 102, a spring 112 which, in use, permits limited upward movement of the anvil 12, a rod 108 and the anvil 12 with respect to the horn 11. A precise adjustment of the gap is then effected by loosening wing screws 98 and rotating a knurled knob 97 to move the rack (95) and the anvil 12 vertically, a pinion (not shown) which meshes with the rack (95) being connected to the knob 97. A threaded stop member 100 which limits downward movement of the rack 95 with respect to the arm 91 is then adjusted to prevent the anvil 12 from approaching the horn 11 closer than the desired gap setting. In use, the blower is operated to direct air across the horn 11 and current is supplied to the element 50 to heat this air to maintain the horn at a predetermined elevated temperature. Then, the pieces to be bonded are either positioned manually between the horn 11 and the anvil 12, or, alternatively, they are advanced by endless belts, 120, 121. The supply of current to the element 50 is stopped and, simultaneously, the horn is vibrated at its ultrasonic resonant frequency to effect bonding. The blower 40 remains in operation and directs a stream of cooling air against the horn 11 to maintain it at the desired temperature and prevent overheating and expansion thereof. After bonding, the vibration of the horn is stopped and the element 50 is again heated to maintain the horn at its elevated temperature. The pieces to be bonded may be preconditioned by the application of heat by passing between either heated elements 125, 126, Fig. 1, or U-shaped members (128), (129), Fig. 6 (not shown), the legs of which are interconnected by resistance wires (131), (132).

[Classes 40 (iii) and 40 (v)] A thermionic regenerating repeater is adapted for receiving D.C. signals at terminals I, Fig. 1, or weak A.C. signals at terminals II, and for passing on square-topped D.C. impulses which are singlecurrent with high output impedance at terminals O1, double-current with low output impedance at terminals 02, and single-current with low output impedance at terminals O3, the margin between the input level required to operate the relay and that required to release it being small. Anode current for the valves 5, 6, Fig. 2, is derived from the potentiometer 1, 2, 3 and the grid 5g is negatively biassed by the potential-drop in resistance 1, so that in the spacing condition valve 5 is blocked and, there being no current in resistance 8, valve 6 is active. When, however, a D.C. pulse is applied to terminals I in such a sense as to oppose the bias, a reversal of these conditions builds up rapidly so that valve 5 is now active and valve 6 is blocked. The critical signallevel at which the change-over takes place can be adjusted by means of the potentiometer 7. The output signal from terminals O1 is singlecurrent with earth return and high output impedance. Part of the circuit shown in Fig. 2 is represented by the square R in Fig. 1. The cessation of current in the resistance 10, Fig. 1, during the marking condition enables valve 12 to become active and its anode current, energized by battery 13, then flows through the load L connected to terminals 02 in a direction opposite to that which was previously taken by the anode current of valve 6, so that doublecurrent signals from a source with relatively low impedance are given out by terminals 02 and single-current low-impedance signals with earth return by terminals 03. Incoming A.C. signals received at terminals II have similar effects, but if their level fluctuates they may first be shaped in a manner appropriate to their input form, according to the setting of the switches 23, 24, 25. They are first filtered, if necessary, at 14 and then passed via the amplifier 15 and rectifier 16 to the relay R through a connection 32 which includes a potentiometer 18 for enabling a weak signal to operate the relay system, and through a connection 33 to which includes a shaping network N. When the envelope of the incoming signals has an abrupt wave-front a voltage-limiter 26 is shunted across the rectifier by means of the switch 23. When the incoming signal is distorted by a narrow-band filter 14, the gain of amplifier 15 can be controlled, upon closure of switch 24, by the action of a rectifier 30 in conjunction with a network 27. With both A.C. and D.C. signals, on closure of switch 25 the network 29 builds up a voltage which is opposed to the signal voltage and can be made to hold an approximately constant value during variations of signal-level."

The stator end plate 49 of the motor, Figs. 10, 11, is connected to an axle 51 by a king pin 52 and is formed with a stub axle 53 upon which the rotor 21 is journalled through a roller bearing 54. A driving shaft 60 having a splined connection 62 with the rotor transmits the drive to a hub 57 having a flange adapted to receive a bolted-on road wheel and journalled through ball bearings 58 upon a hub 59 fast with the stator end plate 50. The rotor 21 contacts with the stator 20 at a point 24 and comprises arcuate vanes 26 which slide in arctuate slots 27, the circumferential length of which is equal to that of the vanes, and are pressed by torsion springs 29 to make sealing contact between the ends 28 and the stator wall. The springs 29 are connected between brackets 45 fast with the vanes and abutment plugs '46 carried by a detachable end plate 36x. Sealing at each end of the rotor is provided by grooves 37. Leakage fluid is drawn off through a'hollow bolt 48x. The pump unit comprises two coaxial rotors A, B, Figs. 7, 8, of unequal axial length and separated by a wall 73. A rotary valve 70 comprises parts 70A, 70B, coacting with outlet ports 31A, 31B, respectively. Port 70A can be turned through 90 degrees from the open position shown to close the outlet port 31A and to provide a bye-pass between the latter and the inlet port 30A. In an intermediate position the passages 84, 85 are bridged, which is equivalent to free wheeling. The part 70B is in general similar to the part 70A, but its ports 87B are spaced axially and angularly from one another, and its position in relation to the part 70A is such that in one position of the valve 70 both of the pumps A, B are delivering fluid, both bye-pass passages 90A, 90B being closed while in two further positions either A or B only is in operation, thus giving a choice of three speed ratios.

A control panel 16a is provided at each side of the arched spray tube system and is provided with 'forward' 'reverse' and 'stop' push buttons 19 and levers 20, 21, 22 for controlling the clutch 12, the control valve 30 and the control valve, (not shown), of the pump 4, respectively. A panel frame 38 having an opaque or transparent screen is mounted at each side of the spray tubes and a waterproof apron 37, depends therefrom and is provided with arm holes 37a whereby an operator can manipulate nozzles 36a on flexible pipes 36 depending from the ends of the spray tubes 17, the pipes 36 being under control of valves 35. Limit switches 24, 25, Fig. 1, are provided on the carriage 1 to co-operate with fixed stops at the ends of the runway, which switches either stop or stop and reverse the motor 2. The switch gear for the apparatus is shown diagrammatically at 23. Also mounted on the carriage 1 is an exhaust fan 70 driven by a motor 71 whereby a vehicle interior may be cleaned by suction through tubes 75, (one only, shown in Fig. 2), and the dirt collected in a bag 78. The motor 71 is controlled by on-and-off buttons of a push button switch 80, Fig. 3. In another embodiment the rails are separate from the troughs and supported by mounting brackets, One trough is then supported below the carriage from the mounting brackets whilst the other trough is carried by a wall adjacent the apparatus. In a further embodiment the spray tubes are adjustable for height relative to the carriage, a cross bar having vertical side members being supported below the carriage and the spray tubes having mounting members with rollers therein engaging in the vertical side members. The spray tubes are connected to the pumps through articulated pipes and are raisable and lowerable by a manual winch and cables."

[Class 81 (ii)] An artificial arm wrist fitting comprises an inturned flange 24 having a side opening 125 into which may be slid the base plate 25 of an artificial hand or other appliance 26, and a projecting lever 42 movable to actuate a drive member 29 and a locking bolt 38 (both displaceably mounted) in and out of engagement with the hand. The lever 42 is attached to the sleeve 41 in which the bolt 38 is retained by a spring 52. The sleeve slides outside the guide 37 and has a flange 45 which, cooperating with a flange 146 formed on a pin 71. restrains a sleeve 66 from sliding forward on a tube 65 under the action of the spring 74. The pin 71 has a key 72 sliding in a slot 73 in the barrel 30 in which the drive member 29 is retained by a spring clip 31 and pressed by a spring 48. The drive member 29 has parallel pins 33 co-operating slidably with flats formed on a rotating shaft 23. The sleeve 66 is keyed to the tube 65 which is rotated as described in Specification 596,206 by flexion of the elbow joint to provide pronation and supination movement for the appliance. Recesses are so placed in a longitudinal slot in the casing in which the lever 42 slides that in succession : (1) the barrel 30 enters a central recess 49 in the base plate of the appliance so that the latter cannot be removed ; (2) the drive member 29 engages a driver 27 for the appliance, while the pin 71 enters a hole 75 in the base plate so that the appliance may be rotated by the tube 65 ; (3) the lock bolt 38 enters the hole 54 in the base plate to prevent rotation while the flange 45 actuates a bell-crank lever 76 which pushes back the flange 69 of sleeve 66 and disengages the pin 71. Rotating the lever 42 in a lateral slot about the wrist axis rotates a flange plate 60 provided with a longitudinal slot only, corresponding to the casing. Cam surfaces on the cams 62 and studs 64 then co-operate to force out a pressure plate 55 against the action of springs mounted between the end plate 35 and the heads of bolts 59 mounted on the pressure plate, so as to firmly clamp the base plate 25. In a modification, Figs. 3-5, the tube 65 and associated mechanism are omitted, and an abutment on the sleeve 41 co-operates with an abutment on the barrel 30. The drive shaft may be rotated as described in Specifications 596,206 or 596,213 or according to a further modification, Figs. 16-17, by a cord and pulley system. A push rod drive system may also be used. Specification 596,209 also is referred to."

[Class 81 (ii)] An artificial arm for below elbow amputation cases comprises an operating member, actuable by a flexion cord, wire, &c. 28 coupled to a rotary driving member at the wrist 25, for moving a hand or other appliance, by a selector mechanism comprising a reversing gear. The pulleys 31, 131, rotated in opposite directions by the cord 28 and restored by the coiled springs 33, 133, carry spring-pressed pawls 41, 141 mounted in slots, which engage ratchet teeth 39, 139 cut in the upper edges of gearwheels 37, 137, mounted below the pulleys, which co-operate with a pinion wheel 38 to drive the shaft 25. A cam-plate 45 restrains the pawls from engagement near the home position of the pulley. The pin 52 carries a catch arm 68 operated by the lever 29, and two rockers 53, 153 having pads 54, 154 which depress the humps 55, 155 to disengage the pulley pawls alternately, according as wires 75, 175 on the rockers coincide with a tooth 50 or an aperture among the seven pairs cut on the underside of a tooth ratchet-wheel 47. Between the pulleys and the rockers a carriage 57, Fig. 5, sliding in a slot 157 is restrained by pins 63, 163, mounted on the pulleys and co-operating with arms 65, 165 from moving to the right under the action of the spring 59. Rotation of the pulleys releases the carriage, while on returning to home position the pins 63, 163 return the carriage to the left, so that the spring-pressed pawl 49 mounted on it advances the ratchet-wheel 47 one tooth and thus reverses the pulley pawl in engagement. Return of the carriage to the left may be prevented by lowering the catch 68 behind the projection 70 on the carriage. The spring 60 prevents the ratchet-wheel advancing more than one tooth at a time. Repeated pulls on the cord hence rotate the shaft in opposite directions unless the reversing gear is disabled. In the Provisional Specification, instead of the ratchet-and-pawl mechanism above described, the reversing gear consists of a pair of bevelwheels, loose on the rotary shaft (' driving member ') and alternately clutched thereto. Specifications 596,206, 596,209 and 596,212 are referred to."

[Class 132 (iii)] [Also in Group XVIII] A mechanical toy comprises a casing divided by a vertical partition into a front compartment containing a figure of the kind having a body pivotally suspended from a movable support and articulated limbs pivoted to the body, and a rear compartment containing mechanism for actuating the movable support, and a forwardly projecting stop on the front of the partition arranged to co-act with tongues provided on the limbs of the figure to effect flexing movements of the limbs. The figure 11, Fig. 1, is visible through a glass front panel of the casing. The articulations 25 of the legs and the pivots 21, by which the legs are secured to the body, are hidden by the skirt of the figure and cardboard straps 22 limit the movement of the legs, which have tongues 28 for co-operation with the stop 29. The figure is pivoted on the bent end of an arm 31, Fig. 2, which projects through an arcuate slot in the partition 15, the other end of the arm 31 being se cured to a spindle 33 in the rear compartment. A balanced double-armed lever 38 is also secured to the spindle 33, the longer arm of which rests on a stop 42 but is adapted to be raised periodically by cams 43, 44 mounted on one of the side discs 45 of a bucket wheel, which is mounted on a spindle carried by brackets 48. The cams are disposed at different radial distances on a diameter so that they move the lever through different arcs. A hopper 52 with two oppositely inclined sides is also arranged in the rear compartment and has an outlet which delivers sand to the bucket wheel, the latter being formed from two side discs, spaced by an annular ring, between which are disposed spaced vanes. The sand is emptied on to the bottom of the compartment and is returned to the hopper via a passage 54, formed by the side of the casing and an inner wall 56, by suitably rotating the casing. A sand-proof sealing strip 56 extends along the edges of the partition 15. In order to prevent the figure overturning as it is moved up and down by the cams end levers, a concealed stop may be arranged to co-operate with a balance pole 18 carried by the figure. Other granular material or water may be used instead of sand and the bucket wheel may be fitted with vanes or blades without side discs. Alternatively, a spring- operated, electric or other motor may be used to drive the cam disc and the apparatus may be used for display purposes. When fitted with an electric motor, the apparatus may be coin freed (see Group XVIII)."

[Class 40 (v)] A broad band directive radio antenna comprises a single linear slot formed by the oppositely disposed edges of conducting sheets and substantially aligned with the desired directivity; feeder means are coupled to opposite points on the edges of the slot at or near one end of it and the width of the slot for at least half its length is made a sufficiently small fraction of the operating wavelength to ensure end fire directivity. The conducting sheets may be flat or curved. The ends of the slot may be short-circuited, left open, flared out, or terminated by the characteristic impedance 8, Fig. 1, of the transmission line formed by the conductors each side of the gap ; the latter arrangement is claimed to give the best directivity, but with a power loss of about 3 decibels. The conducting sheets whose edges form the antenna may be spaced over a parallel conducting sheet and, if desired, the outside edges of the antenna sheets may be bent down and attached to the parallel sheet, forming a slotted open-ended tube. In another form of the antenna, the slot may be formed between the edge of one conducting sheet and the surface of another, the sheets being preferably perpendicular to each other. In a further form, a groove or indentation is formed in a conducting sheet, the depth of the groove being an odd number of quarter wavelengths and the gap at the top of the indentation being the antenna slot. The slot antennas may be used for transmission or reception and the feeders 12 are connected at one end (Fig. 1) unless the end is short-circuited when they should be attached approximately a quarter wavelength from it (Fig. 8). A discussion of the theory of the antennas is given. Specification 515,684 is referred to."

435,1589975,23360696,"682. Clark, A. M., [Margueritte, L. J. F.]. Feb. 22. Purifying syrups; glucose; treacle.-In purifying syrups of beet-root, cane, maple, or other sugar- producing substance, sulphuric, phosphoric, or other acid, preferably hydrochloric, is mixed with the syrup, which is then boiled in vacuo or other- wise at a temperature not exceeding 140‹ F. When it is desired to avoid inversion of the sugar in order to extract it in a crystallizable state, the proportion of the acid to the dry matter or ashes should be carefully adjusted. The syrup is then dissolved in water and boiled with fine animal charcoal by injecting steam, and is then saturated with lime. The charcoal is removed by decanta- tion, filtration, or by a centrifugal machine. If necessary, the syrup is filtered through animal charcoal before acidulation. The chlorides formed by the use of hydrochloric acid may be separated from the molasses by dialysis or osmosis. In treating saccharine juices to extract crystallizable sugar, the juice is defecated and saturated in the usual way and brought to a density of 27‹ to 30‹ BÚ., and is discharged from the triple-effect apparatus or evaporator into a trough, where, after cooling, it is mixed with a certain quantity of acid and is then returned to the third pan of the apparatus, or is placed in a special apparatus and concentrated in vacuo as highly as possible at the lowest possible temperature, which should not exceed 140‹F. Ammonium chloride or sulphate or free acids may be used. For beet-root juice, hydrochloric acid, and for cane juice, sulphuric acid is used. The syrup is re-dissolved in water and filtered through animal charcoal to remove any acidity before being granulated or converted into glucose syrup. The processes of adding the acid &c. may be applied to the second quality of the product, the mass being mixed and then centrifugaled. The acid decomposes the viscous salts in the molasses, so that the syrup may be clarified by water to which a little saccharate of lime may be added. The acidulated syrup which drains from the hydro-extractor is concentrated to produce a third quality of syrup to which the processes described may be applied. A clarifying agent for purifying inferior sugars may be formed by adding hydrochloric or other acid to the molasses which when evaporated in vacuo and converted into molasses of good flavour may be used an indefinite number of times by the addition of fresh acid. Biphosphate of lime is employed in practice instead of phosphoric acid. The syrups are used in the manufacture of fermented beverages or preserves, or for consumption."

India-rubber, vulcanizing.-In a method of and means for moulding pneumatic and similar tyres, an annular groove B is formed in a plate A and in it is placed a quantity of india-rubber, preferably in the form of cord, sufficient to form a cover. The groove is then covered by a second plate A, which may have a similar groove B in its upper surface, so that a number of covers can be simultaneously moulded. The plates are then clamped together and placed in a steam or other oven till the rubber has been moulded to a ring of a similar section to the groove, the outer edge D being thin and the inner one C thick. To bring the cover to its final shape, the thick inner edge C of the ring has to be enlarged to the diameter of the outer one D, and this is effected on a mandrel or drum E, Fig. 4, the edge being thereby brought to the same diameter and thickness as the edge D.

Non - metallic substances, obtaining.-Ins o l u b l e or sparingly soluble salts of heavy metals are prepared bv a modification of the process described in Specification 14,801/95. The cathodes 2, 3 which, like the anodes 1, are made of the heavy metal, or of an alloy of heavy metals, are now constructed to hold a porous depolarizer consisting of the corresponding oxides. The depolarizer is regenerated by atmospheric oxidation after removal of the electrolyte by a pipe 8. The strength of the electrolyte is maintained during the process by additions of the precipitating-salt and, if necessary, of the dissolving salt. One or more cathodes 3 are fitted in frames, optionally with filter-cloths, so as to form porous cells from which alkali is removed, say by a siphon 6; the other cathodes may be similarly enclosed. The alkali may be used to form the precipitating-salt; for instance, it may be treated with carbonic acid in a vessel 10 and pumped back into the cell. In making neutral chromate of lead, the electrolyte. contains about one and a half per cent of a mixture of 95 parts of sodium chlorate and 5 parts of anhydrous sodium bichromate; salts of potassium or ammonium may replace these. For Prussian or Paris blue, a one per cent solution of a similar mixture of chloride and ferrocyanide may be used, and, for white ead, a one or two per cent solution of a mixture of chlorate and carbonate.

Lock mechanism. lever type; master - key mechanism.-In a masterkey lock. two or more independent sets of levers are employed, each set adapted to be operated by one of the keys, and the bolt stump being arranged to allow the bolt to be withdrawn by either of the keys. In the form shown, with two sets of levers 5, 5', the bolt stump comprises two spring-controlled slides 12, 12' mounted on a plate 16 secured to the bolt, and each adapted to co-operate with one of the lever sets. A pivoted cam-piece 14 mounted on the plate 16 allows either one of the slides to move inwards against the spring, but prevents motion of both at the same time. When one of the lever sets has been operated by its key, the corresponding slide can pass into the lever gatings when the bolt is withdrawn, the other slide being pressed back by the other set of levers. By reversing the cam-piece 14, both slides can be locked against motion, and the lock used with a key operating all the levers. As shown on the drawings, the levers are adjustable to suit different keys. Each lever is pivoted on a slide 15 which is adjustable in a vertical direction. When the two sets of levers are employed, two clamping-screws 8<a>, 8<b>, one for each set, are used, so that each set is separately adjustable."

Theatrical appliances.-Relates to an apparatus for the production of optical illusions, more especially intended for advertising purposes, in which a sheet of glass C, Fig. 1, is placed at an angle of 45 degrees to a pair of pictures a<3>, and one picture as viewed through an aperture a is caused to fade into the other The pictures are illuminated by electric lamps D, and the current supplied to the lamps is controlled by a rotary rheostat E, which is driven by a motor B. The current supplied to the lamps for one picture gradually increases, while at the same time the current supplied to the other lamps gradually decreases, and the rheostat is so arranged that the total illumination of the images as seen by the observer remains practically constant. During the period of darkness, the picture is changed by means of the device shown in Fig. 2. The pictures are wound upon spring rollers f mounted between two disks G, the edges of which have notches g<1> for the reception of the picture rods f<1>. The mechanism for extending the pictures consists of endless chains H at each side of the framework, which are driven by the motor B, Fig. 1, and each chain carries a spring finger h<2> which engages a picture rod f<1>, and gradually extends the picture. When extended, the picture is held by notches j on disks J, pins h<3> on the chain engaging spiders K fixed to the disks J, thus giving the disk a partial rotation to bring the picture into the viewing position and releasing the previous picture from its notch. The released picture drops until the ends of its rod f<1> engage carrier blocks M on a second moving chain m, and is gradually lowered until it is completely wound up. In a modification, when the picture is extended, the ends of its rod f<1> are held in inclined guides by means of spring stops, which are withdrawn by the rod of the succeeding picture."

Pulp, catching and recovering. -Relates to apparatus for removing fibre, loading, and like materials from the waste water of paper-making and like machines, and rendering the water fit for re-use. The apparatus comprises a series of tanks a<1> ... a<4> each having an annular channel in its upper part, a partition e extending into the interior, and a stationary or vibrating filter f of wire cloth or other suitable material, and the tanks are connected at their lower ends by a pipe i having one of the valves k<1>, k<2>, k<3> between each pair of connexions. The waste water is delivered to the first tank a<1> and falls down the outside of the partition e. The fibres and the bulk of the loading collect at the bottom, and the water overflows through the filter into the second tank a<2> and is relieved, as it passes through a finer filter, of all or nearly all the remaining clay, and is delivered to a third tank a<3>, where any clay remaining in the water is arrested by a still finer filter f, and only clear water passes to the tank a<4>. The valves k<1>, k<2>, k<3> are loaded or controlled to open at a given pressure and when the contents of the tank a<1>, usually fibre and loading, are discharged below a certain level, the valve k<1> opens owing to difference of pressure and allows the clay to be discharged from the tank a<2>. When the contents of the tank a<2> fall below a certain level, the valve k<2> opens, and thus the apparatus allows a certain definite proportion of fibre, clay, and water to be discharged to the beaters. The same action may take place when water is supplied from the tanks to the potchers, the valve k<3> being set to open in the other direction when the water in the fourth tank falls below a certain level. The water from the tank a<4>, not used by the potchers, may be used by the spray-pipes, and to maintain a constant head, a cistern n may be connected to the tank a<4> and, as a reserve, to a main supply pipe o, ball cocks being provided. A filter of quartz or other material may be provided in the cistern, and the pipes may be arranged so that a reverse current of water may be used to wash the cistern. The tanks may be provided at the bottom with stop-cocks for overhauling purposes. The number of tanks and filters may vary, and the tanks may be used with or without discharge valves; in some cases a valvecontrolled pipe p may lead from the tank a<2> to the paper-machine. The filters f may be near the top of the tanks or lower down, and there may be one or more tanks for the beaters and one or more for the potchers, the pipe connexions being separate or combined."

Monogrammic signs and signals.-Words and numbers are built up from a field of pivoted elements situated behind apertures in the front of a casing and arranged to be rocked in groups. Electro-magnetic actuating and selecting devices are provided, including a distributor which puts the sections of the indicator successively under control of a keyboard, so that an announcement can be written down as on a typewriter. The inside of the casing may be illuminated, and each element may consist of a transparent or translucent ball, cup, or lens, Fig. 3, with an opaque portion 2b normally blocking the aperture 7, or of a rocking transparent cup with a folding-blind attachment. Or the elements may consist of complete spheres or cylinders, solid or hollow, and optionally filled with liquid. External illumination may be employed, the rocking balls &c. being adapted to reflect light from part of their surfaces. For daylight use, the balls are coloured. The rocking-motion of each element on its pivot 6, Fig. 3, is effected through connexions 8, 9, 13 by the core 15 of a pair of solenoids 16, 17, which effect the forward and return motions respectively. The indicator field is divided into sections C, Fig. 1, each consisting of thirty-five elements, the ' forward ' solenoids 16 of which are connected to a transverse row of thirty-five contacts 27 on a board 28. There is a row of contacts 27 for each of the sections C, and, when operations are commenced, the contacts 27 of the first of the sections C are engaged by a row of contacts 37 on a non-conductive band 34. Each contact 37 is connected, through a metal strip running lengthways in the band, with a fixed contact 39 on which the metal strip presses. If now a key, such as 42, is depressed, a circuit is completed from battery 31 through a number of leads 40 connected with certain of the contacts 39 and through the corresponding contacts 27 of the first section C, and a character or numeral corresponding to the key depressed appears in this section. The return motion of the key 42 closes the circuit of a solenoid 47, which, by means of a pawl 45, advances the band 34 and brings the contacts 37 into engagement with the second row of contacts 27. The effect of depressing a second key is therefore to display a character in the second section C, and so on. The distributor may be operated non-automatically. A spacing-key is provided, and also a key for wiping-out an existing inscription by energizing all the ' return' solenoids 17. Wiping-out is also effected automatically by contacts 51 when the contacts 37 have passed the last row of contacts 27. When it is only required to display a numeral, for instance, in calling carriages, each section U may have a separate series of switches numbered from 0 to 9, and each switch is preferably adapted to wipe out the numeral previously shown."

Link-work; cam mechanism. - R elates to means for converting a continuous rotary motion into an intermittent rotary motion, of the kind in which three slotted or grooved members are interconnected by pins or the like, so that, one memb e r being fixed, continuous rotation of the second member is transmitted intermittently to the third member. Concent r i c cylindrical members interconnected by radially - disposed pins are employed. A number of such devices may be connected in series to obtain extended periods of intermittence, while in such a case the motion may be taken through a countershaft from any member of the series, providing a variable-speed effect. As shown in Figs. 1 and 2, pins i slidable in a longitudinally slotted cylindrical driven member b are guided by a zigzag groove a<2> formed on the periphery of an inner fixed cylindrical member a, and are driven intermittently by an outer cylindrical member c, which may be a pulley or gear-wheel, with an internal annular groove o composed of longitudinal parts o<1> connected by circumferential parts o<2>. The longitudinal parts o<1> of the driving- groove correspond to the effective portion of the drive, lost motion occurring when the pins, guided by the fixed zigzag groove a<2>, come into line with the circumferential portions o<2> of the groove o. The distance between the latter portions o<2> of the driving-groove being less than that between the angular points of the fixed zigzag groove, the pins i are locked during the lost-motion period and until they reach the prolongations o<3> of the longitudinal portions o<1> of the groove, which enable them to pass the angles of the zigzag groove. In a modification, the driving and driven cylindrical members are formed as flanges on disks formed with or attached to toothed pinions geared respectively to driving and driven shafts, the device being arranged in an oil-retaining casing. In the variable-speed device shown in Fig. 5, a number of devices of the kind described are connected in series, the intermittently-driven member e of the first device c<1> forming the driving- member of the second device c<2>, and so on. Each of the members e being geared to loose pinions k on a slidable countershaft j, the latter may be driven with intermittent periods of variable degree according to which of the pinions is clutched thereto."

A cam 6, Fig. 1, oscillates a lever 15 and so reciprocates a rod 24, a box-frame 26 and a frame 30 connected with the lifter lever, and a cam 28 is interposed between the two frames, so that, as it is gradually rotated by a ratchet-wheel 28 and pawl 37, which is operated during each reciprocation by a lever and an adjustable stop 38, it alters the effective length of the rod 24 and moves the limits of the lift of the ring rail first in one direction and then in the other. The cam 28 makes more than one revolution during the formation of each bobbin. The second cam may be disposed on a lever operated by the cam 6 and arranged to work in or against a swinging lever adjustably connected with the lifting-levers. A spring stop 84 engages with a wheel connected to the ratchetwheel and serves, when the pawl is disconnected in order to wind on to bobbins with flanges, to hold the parts in position so that the only motion communicated to the ring rail or lifter rail is that of the cam 6.

Shuttle-changing mechanism. - In shuttlechanging mechanism in which the shuttle-box front 12 is lowered and the backboard 14 raised to enable a fresh shuttle to be introduced and the spent shuttle to be ejected, these movements are effected by the beating-up of the lay, and the box front and backboard are returned to normal position immediately the lay reaches its foremost position. The front 12 and backboard 14 are carried by two rods 7 and two rods 8 secured to two levers 5 on a shaft 1, which carries a striking-lever 17 provided with a stud carrying a bowl 19. A lateral projection on a part 24 connected adjustably by a screw to a bell-crank lever 23 is raised into the path of the bowl 19 by connexions from the weft-fork mechanism, so that, when the lay beats up, the striking-lever 17 and shaft 1 are rocked, the front 12 being lowered and the backboard raised against the action of a spring 25. The bowl rolls over and slips off the projection on the part 24, when the lay is forward, and the spring returns the parts to normal position The guiding-bosses 9, 10 of the rods 7, 8 are preferably inclined so that the backboard when lifted may be moved back somewhat, and on its return may move the fresh shuttle to the front again, if it should have been pushed a little too far back. When the weft-fork mechanism is actuated, a lateral projection on a slide-block on the weft-fork rod encounters an arm fixed on a cross-shaft 38, which is thereby rocked, and a stud 40 on a lever fixed on the shaft engages in a slot in the, arm 27 of the lever' 23, thus raising the abutment on the part 24 into position to engage the bowl .19. The return movement of the lever 23, under the action of gravity or a spring, is limited by a set-screw on a lug on the bracket 21. A bar 61 adjustably fixed by a screw to a swivel piece 60 on a lever 52 rests upon the part 24, so that, when the latter is raised and the lay beats up, the hooked nose 62 of the part 61 engages a plate 63 fixed to a lay-sword and the lever 52 is rocked. A cross-rod 48 held between the lever 52 and a spring-actuated jaw 53 pivoted on this lever is thus moved, and a block 47 carried thereby is thus reciprocated along two guidespindles, and push-rods 49 then feed a fresh shuttle from the magazine into the shuttle box, the spent shuttle being ejected from the box and being temporarily held against a plate 65 carried by spring-actuated rods 69. When the backboard 14 is lowered, the shuttle is ejected into the shoot 68. The hook-shaped nose 62 is held up by the plate 63 until the lay begins to move backwards, whereupon the plate 63 engages the turned-up end of the bar 61 and returns it nearly to its position of rest, a spring 56 which prevents undue vibration completing the return movement. To guide the fresh shuttle into the box, a frame 70 open to receive the picker is fixed in the shuttle box and has projecting tongs to meet the turned-up back of the magazine, while other prongs 72 formed on the shuttle-box bottom pass between the anglebrackets 43 supporting the magazine. In fastreed looms, the back swell is fixed on the backboard or on one of the supporting-rods, and the back-swell lever, fixed on the stop-rod, is made longer and may be cranked laterally so as to engage the swell while it is lifted. The back edge of the frame or plate 70 is chamfered on its underside, to press the swell back as it is lifted up with the backboard and thus prevent it from catching on the plate 70."

In a branch exchange using line finders, each subscriber's line Na, Nb is connected to a calldetecting circuit comprising rectifiers Grl, Gr2, a resistor W1, an engaged signal lamp NL and a common start relay G, and calling lines are characterized by a distinct potential on one of the line wires. When a subscriber initiates a call by completing the line loop, relay G operates and pulls up AN to start one or more line finders AS. The calling line is identified over line finder wiper b by a test relay P which operates in parallel with the start relay and stops the line finder by disabling AS. Relay PR then operates slowly to ensure a satisfactory test and pulls up relay V over S(2) to busy the line by connecting earthed positive potential to wiper b. Negative (- 24v) and earth potentials are also applied to wipers a and c respectively, and the rectifiers Gr1, Gr2, Gr3 are rendered non-conductive by potentials of - 16v and - 8 volts on the subscriber's line wires Na and Nb, the different potential values arising from the resistance of relays D and S1 and the subscriber's loop circuit. With this arrangement the calldetecting circuit is disconnected from the line for the duration of the call.

[Class 40 (v)] [Also in Group XXXV] A resonant circuit is automatically trimmed by feeding the circuit with a frequencymodulated signal of mean carrier frequency equal to that desired for the resonant circuit and feeding the rectified output from the circuit to a phase-sensitive motor which drives the trimming tool. As applied to trimming the -I.F. amplifier of a superheterodyne receiver R, the output from a signal generator FMG is first applied to the last tuned circuit of the I.F. stage. The generator output is of the desired I.F. and is frequency modulated at a low frequency derived, e.g. from a 50-cycle mains supply PS through a transformer TR and adjustable phase-shifter PC. The output from the I.F. stage being trimmed is rectified in the normal receiver detector stage, passed through shaping and filtering circuits SFC to remove harmonics of the mains-frequency, amplified at AMP and then fed to the. armature ARM of a shunt wound commutator motor M, the field FD of which is fed from the 50-cycle main supply PS over secondary S2 of the transformer TR. The motor rotates in a direction dependent on the phase difference between the field and armature currents and drives through a flexible shaft a screw-driver which is applied to the adjusting screw of the trimming condenser forming a part of the circuit being tuned. The motor stops when the circuit is in time, since the F.M. swing of the generator output is then symmetrical about the resonance curve of the circuit being trimmed. This process is then repeated for the preceding I.F. tuned circuits in turn. To prevent hunting of the motor M, negative feedback of a value proportional to the motor speed and derived from an auxiliary. armature winding AW, is applied to the amplifier AMP through a fixed phase-shifter PSN. The arrangement may be adapted for trimming the R.F. and local oscillator circuits. Both the amplitude of the the output from generator FMG and the frequency swing may be controlled by the receiver output. Specification 518,480 is referred to."

A milled nut 16 acting on a screw 21 may vertically adjust the disc housing relative to the waveguide and therefore the mean penetration by the disc and the carrier level, this being indicated on a scale 31 by a pointer 32 actuated by a centre hub of the disc. A two-pole rotor 35 on the alternator shaft located between the two poles of a stator which may be energized by coils 35 acts as an electromagnetic brake bringing the alternator to rest with the disc coupled to it in one of the two mean positions of penetration into the waveguide, for measuring the mean carrier level. An adjustable attentuator further down the waveguide may be used for restoring the mean carrier level to a constant level after adjustment of the depth of modulation, and may be automatically adjusted by the latter adjustment. A grubscrew 38 permits coarse adjustment of the disc and alternator rotor and therefore of the reference phase.

A radio reflector capable of being packed into a small space for transport and storage comprises an inflatable flexible tubular framework carrying or forming part of the reflecting surfaces proper and maintaining the said surfaces in tension when inflated. In one construction of reflector according to the invention there is provided a flexible tubular framework comprising a central king-post 1 from which extend arms 2 connected at their outer ends by outer members 3. The members 3 are linked by downward tubes 5 with the lower end of the king- post. Moulded coupling members 4 connect the tubes at their junctions and strengthening tie wires 7 are used between the top of the king- post and the outer ends of arms 2. The members 3 may, when inflated, outline a rectangle as shown or else a circle (Fig. 2, not shown). Likewise the tubes 5 may be straight, curved outwardly, or replaced by the wires. The framework may also be arranged without a king- post and in another embodiment consists of three intersecting circular tubes of equal dimensions, having a common centre point, and lying in three mutually perpendicular planes (Fig. 4, not shown). A very simple framework is shown in Fig. 5 and comprises four similar tubes 14 having an angle at their centres 15 and joined together at their extremities by suitable moulded couplings 4. Whatever the arrangement of the framework the spaces between the members are filled with radio-wave reflecting surfaces forming a group of corner reflectors. The surfaces may be of open mesh, for example knitted wire material or metallized textile material, or of metallized sheet material. The flexible tubes may be formed in natural or synthetic rubber or of a thermoplastic substance and the edges of the reflector surfaces may be attached to tubes of reflective or non-reflective mesh material surrounding the flexible tubes or to an integral flange moulded on the latter tubes (Figs. 6 and 7, not shown). A supporting ring 8 whereby the reflector may be attached below a balloon is provided and a further ring 9 for a sonde. An inflation valve 23 is arranged on a suitable part of the framework and where it is intended to use the reflector actually inside the supporting balloon (Fig. 8, not shown) the valve may be on an extension tube projecting through the balloon neck."

Signalling and communicating between trains; signalling-instruments.-In apparatus for polarizing Hertzian waves to cause signals emitted from a spark-gap transmitter to be received only by companion receivers, and suitable for use in railway and marine signalling and other applications of wireless telegraphy, the spark-gap terminals a, b, and the induction coil e of the transmitter are enclosed in chambers having wire gauze or netting &c. walls which confine the waves emitted except in so far as they escape through a narrow slot l in a rotatable disc j. The receiving-coherer is similarly enclosed, so that it is only affected by waves properly polarized to pass through the slot of a second rotatable disc. The apparatus shown in Fig. 4, specially for railway signalling, is fitted with two polarizing-discs j, k on the transmitting-chamber c, and with two separate coherers f, g and selecting- discs m, n so that signals may be transmitted and received in two directions, e.g., to and from trains on two separate tracks. The discs j, k, m, n may be held by clips v, and connected for simultaneous operation by levers p and a connecting-rod q fitted with an indicating-finger u and operating-handle r. The discs may be made in the form of slotted gratings. It is stated that the coherer is affected only if the slots l, o lie in parallel planes at angles differing by less than 60‹ and inclined to the horizontal or spark-gap plane at angles at from 30 to 150‹. As the discs of engines upon one track are set with their slots at 45‹ from the horizontal and those upon the other at 135‹, signals cannot be transmitted between the two sets of engines. The receivers and transmitters may be placed in unconnected chambers, when desirable."

The strains in the model are measured by the strain gauges, which are individually switched into a calibrated Wheatstone net circuit having temperature compensating resistors, and since these strains correspond to the strains in the full-scale aircraft, the stresses in the latter may be calculated from the known Young's modulus of the material from which it is to be constructed. The scale of the model is chosen so that the strains due to the gravitational field are as nearly as possible equal in the model and in the full-scale aircraft."

The back-and-forth movement of the table, which is mounted on slideways 32 on a cross-slide 24 carried in slideways 30, is effected by a flexible rack 38 secured at its ends to the table and driven over rollers 44 by a pinion 40 which is slidable on a splined shaft 42 driven in opposite directions from a reversing mechanism 56 by a D.C. motor 52 and speedreduction gear 54. The reversing mechanism is operated at each end of the back-and-forth movement of the table by arms 68, 69 secured to the table and actuating the rocket 67 of a switch 66 so that two electro-magneticallyoperated clutches 59, 60 in the reversing mechanism 56 are alternately energized; the circuits of the electro-magnets controlling the clutches contain variable resistances which control the amount of slip of the clutches and, therefore, the abruptness of the reversal of the table. Variation of the voltage supplied to the armature of the D.C. motor 52 controls the speed of reciprocation of the table 12. Lateral advance of the cross-slide 24 on the slideways 30 is provided at either or both ends of the back-andforth movement by a three-phase motor 85 driving a speed-reduction gear 86 and the clutch 83 which, when engaged with a member 82 splined to a shaft 80, rotates a lead screw 48 to axially move a nut 46 secured to the crossslide; movement of the nut carries the pinion 40 along the shaft 42 to maintain the rack 38 in alignment; when the clutch 83 is disengaged, the member 82 is held against rotation by a brake clutch 84 secured to the frame 10 of the machine. The clutch 83 is engaged and clutch 84 disengaged at the same time as one or other of the clutches 59, 60 is operated under the control of relays actuated by the switch 66. Simultaneously, an adjustable time-delay relay-mechanism is operated to maintain the clutch 83 in engagement for a length of time depending upon the increment of lateral movement reauired; on the completion of the time delay, the clutch 83 is disengaged and clutch 84 engaged. Limit switches 88.7, which co-operate with lugs 88.8 on the cross slide 24 are provided on the frame at the limits of the full lateral movement in both directions to reverse the connections to the motor 85 and, therefore, the direction of lateral movement. The motor 85 may be connected by a clutch 105 to a shaft 106 which imparts vertical movement to a spindle head 26 and grinding wheel 14. The back and forth and lateral movements of the table are automatically controlled by relays which close circuits to energise the electro-magnets operating the clutches. Manual control of the clutches and motor 85 is provided by push-buttons arranged on a panel 110 mounted on the machine. Manual operation of the longitudinal movement of the table is provided by a handwheel 18 which, when a clutch 64 is engaged and the clutches 59, 60 are inoperative, is connected to the reversing mechanism 56 and shaft 42. The lateral movement may be similarly manually operated when the clutch 84 is disengaged by a handwheel 20 which is geared to the lead screw 48.

Rapidity of action is effected by the reduction of the timeconstant of the controlled shunt field by the insertion of a series resistor. In Fig. 1, the exciter 6 is in series with the shunt field 7 of generator 5, and is connected to assist the main exciting voltage. Resistor 8 is provided to reduce the time-constant of winding 7. Field winding 9 of exciter 6 is connected across the output of generator 5 in series with resistor 10 which is short-circuited for longer or shorter periods by the contacts 12 of relay 11 according as the output voltage of generator 5 falls or rises with respect to a datum level determined by variable resistor 13. High-frequency contact vibration is maintained by impulsing condenser 14 which renders the relay 11 more sensitive to transient charges of the controlled voltage. In a modification, Fig. 2 (not shown), the sensitivity of relay 11 is increased by a thermionic amplifying means. In Fig. 3, the field winding 27 of alternator 25 is supplied by D.C. generator 26. The output of 26 is controlled by the circuit elements as in Fig. 1, the vibrator 32 being subjected to the control of relay 33 which in this case is connected to the alternator output through rectifier 22. A rise of alternator output causes a rise in the current through 33 which causes contacts 32 to open for longer periods and insert resistor 31 into field circuit 30 with consequent fall of the output voltage of 29 and the excitation of 26. In Fig. 4 (not shown), the sensitivity of relay 33 is raised by supplying it from rectifier 22 through a thermionic amplifying device, in this case the make periods instead of the breaks are increased by a rise of current in the coil.

In one embodiment, Fig. 1, the voltage between bus-bars 65, supplied by generator 58, is controlled by the action of vibrating relay 63, 64 on the field 62 of exciter 60 which supplies the exciting current to the field 59 of generator 58. The anode current of thermionic valve 66 passes through relay operating coil 64'and is controlled by grid 68 which is connected to the positive bus-bar, the cathode being taken to the negative bus-bar. A rise in the output voltage of 58 causes an increase in the current through valve 66, and consequently through coil 64, to open contacts 63. Resistor 61 is thereby inserted into the shunt field circuit of exciter 60 to cause a reduction of its output voltage and a lowering of the generated E.M.F. of 58. In a second embodiment, Fig. 2, voltage control of generator 71 is achieved by the connection of a carbon-pile or carbon-silver-pile resistor 72, in series with the field 73. The compressive force on the pile is varied by means of the arm 74, coil 75 and thermionic amplifier 76, to produce corresponding changes in its resistance which are such as to cause a correction in the induced armature, E.M.F. for any alteration in the bus-bar voltage from a datum level fixed by potentiometer 84. A rise in bus-bar voltage with the resultant increase in negative potential of the grid 77 causes a fall of current through anode 79, a lowering of the compressive force on pile 72 and a correcting fall of induced voltage. A fall of bus-bar voltage is corrected by a similar sequence of operations initiated by an increase in the current through the thermionic valve. Hunting is countered by the condenser 80 which tends to damp rapid oscillations of the pile 72, the degree of damping depending on the product of the capacitance of 80 and the resistance of resistor 82. In a third embodiment, Fig. 3 (not shown), the output voltage of the associated exciter generator through a vibrating contact relay the operating coil of which is supplied by a thermionic amplifier from alternator bus-bars. In Fig. 4 (not shown), speed control of a D.C. motor is affected by the influence .of a negative booster on the shunt field of the motor, the booster output being subject to the control of a vibrating contact relay, the operating coil of which is supplied by a thermionic amplifier, the input to which is taken from a magneto generator driven by the motor. In a further embodiment, Figs. 5 and 6 (not shown), speed control of a shaft is accomplished by the control of the excitation of an eddy-current clutch of the slipping type..The controlled shaft is driven through a clutch from a prime mover and has coupled to it a magneto-generator. The output voltage of the latter is amplified by thermionic means and controls a vibrating contact relay which influences the output of a generator supplying the excitation to the clutch.

Diluents include nitrogen, hydrogen, water vapour, methane, butane or other saturated hydrocarbon, generally in the ratio of diluent to alkene of 1 to 10 : 1, preferably 2 : 1, by volume under the reaction conditions. Where cracked alkene fractions are used as feedstock, saturated hydrocarbons within the range specified are generally present. Small amounts of water are preferably also added. A continuous vapour phase process is advantageous. Normal butene fractions may be treated to increase the isobutene content to, say, 10 per cent, followed by interpolymerization of the butenes, and further isomerization of the residue. In examples, normal butene with an equal volume of water vapour is passed over copper-cadmium or copper-calcium acid phosphate at about 300 DEG C. and atmospheric pressure while a normal butene fraction containing an excess of butanes over butenes is passed with water in a mass ratio to hydrocarbon of 0.9 or 0.1 over the same catalysts at 350 DEG C. and 80 p.s.i. Specification 496,676 also is referred to. The provisional Specifications refer to the use of acid phosphates of metals of Groups 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7 or 8 with or without normal phosphates."

614,1593353,20957092,"592,270. Photographic reproduction processes. KODAK, Ltd. (Eastman Kodak Co., and Yule, J. A. C.). Jan. 21, 1944, Nos. 449/45 (divided out of Complete Specification of 579,239) and 1122/45. Drawings to Specification. [Class 98 (ii)] An outline image, or an image of enhanced outline, is made by contact or projection printing from a continuous-tone photographic record while it is in register with an image mask of complementary density thereto (i.e. a positive if the record is a negative, and vice versa), the mask having an absorption gamma (as defined in Specification 553,196) between 70 per cent and 130 per cent that of the record, and being unsharp and used sharply or unsharply (i.e. in or out of exact printing relation with the sensitive surface). The print simulates an engraving, the outlines occurring wherever there is an abrupt density change in the record. The outlines alone are printed if the mask is within 5 per cent of 100 per cent, but a residual amount of the continuous-tone record also is printed if the mask differs otherwise, within the extent stated, from 100 per cent and the exposure is sufficient. This residual amount may be varied, if desired, after the record and mask have been made, by colouring, e.g. one of them, and using a printing light of selected colour ; a similar result may be achieved, after an outline negative has been made, by making a composite print from the outline negative and the continuous-tone record. If the record is made so that the shadows exhibit higher contrast than the high-lights (by using the toe of the characteristic curve when making a positive record, or the shoulder of the curve when making a negative record), the masked print from the record has outlines which are broader in the shadows than in the highlights. By selecting the gamma of the mask and varying the exposure, the print may be made to exhibit black or white outlines, with possibly outlines of both kinds in the shadows. If the record is of a subject against an out-offocus background, the latter does not print at all since it does not exhibit abrupt density changes, so that the result is an outline print of the subject only. Any of the ways of masking described in Specification 579,239 may be used ; preference is given to printing with parallel light through an unsharp negative mask as nearly as possible in contact with a sharp positive record which is in contact with the sensitive material. For photo-mechanical half-tone work, a positive or negative may be made by printing the record on to the same sensitive film in two stages, using in one a mask as described above for producing outlines, and in the other a half-tone screen ; and in this case also, in order if desired to adjust the contrasts of the final print, any pair of the three elements, record, mask, and half-tone screen may be coloured differently, with appropriate selection of the colour of the printing lights. The Specification describes in detail the production of outline prints in the preferred way above-mentioned, and also the production of a composite outline and half-tone screened print, using where required either parallel light, or a uniformly extended printing source, or a ring source (or its equivalent produced by illuminating the printing zone by light falling thereon at a constant obliquity while effecting relative rotation between the source and the combination of elements being printed). For carrying out the invention, an integral masking sensitive film may be used whereon a sharp continuous-tone positive (or negative) record is first made in a blue-sensitive emulsion layer, which may also be sensitive to green but not to red, on a support backed by a black antihalation dye layer, the dye of which is removed or bleached in the bath used to develop the record, over which dye layer is coated a red-sensitive emulsion layer in which the unsharp negative (or positive) mask is printed during the development of the record by exposing the material to a beam of diffuse red light. The antihalation dye may be contained in the red-sensitive layer, and if the record sensitive layer is blue-sensitive only, the mask sensitive layer may be sensitive to red or green or to both, printing being effected with light of corresponding colour or colours. An outline negative may be used for the grey key record in multi-colour work. The invention is distinguished from known methods of producing relief or cameo effects by printing from the combination of a positive and negative placed slightly out of register, but may, if desired, be combined with such methods. U.S.A. Specification 2,304,988 is referred to in connection with the use of coloured photo-mechanical halftone screens. Specifications 411,718, 544,034 and 592,296 also are referred to."

[Class 44] [Also in Group XXX] The drive switch operating member of an electric lift also operates a well or cage doorlocking element and a feeler which is held against movement when the door is open, so that the switch cannot be closed to operate the lift unless the door is closed and locked. As shown (Fig. 5), a bolt 3 is slidable vertically in a housing 11 of the well door lintel to engage a keeper 25 in the top of a swing door 7. The bolt is operated by a horizontal slide bar 18 having a plate 15 with a cam-slot 19 engaging a pin 23 coupled to the bolt, the cam-slot having horizontal end portions to lock the bolt in its extended and retracted positions. The feeler 4 is similarly constructed, and operated by the slide bar 18 simultaneously with the bolt 3. It can only be extended, however, when the door is closed and a slot or keeper 26 in the door registered with it, either the door itself or an extension 27 obstructing movement otherwise. The slide bar 18 has a pin and cam-slot connection 36, 80 with an operating member 78 slidable vertically in a lock box 2 mounted in the lift well, the operating member 78 also having a pin and cam-slot connection 79, 71 with a switch 32 controlling the lift drive. Both cam-slots 79, 80 have vertical end portions to lock the switch 32 and bar 18 in their end positions. In operation, downward movement of the operating member 78 first frees the bar 18, then pulls it to the right and relocks it. This releases the bolt 3 and feeler 4 and projects them into locking engagement with the door and then relocks them, but if the door is open, the feeler 4 is held and movement of the operating member 78 is arrested. The final movement of the operating member closes the lift switch 32. The door 7 shown is one of a pair of swing doors, the rod 18 being extended to operate the bolt and feeler of the other. The bolt 3, moreover, is adapted to depress a spring- retracted push-rod 100 to lock the lower edge of the door to the sill. A Bowden connection, Figs. 15 and 16 (not shown), may, alternatively, operate a lock in the sill from the lock box 2. The operating member 78 in the lock box 2 may be actuated automatically by a motor or electromagnet, but, in the arrangement shown, it is adapted to be engaged and actuated by a bar 46 projected from a controller 1 mounted in the lift cage. A similar arrangement of bolt and feeler may be applied to the cage door and be operated by the controller direct.

[Class 38 (iv)] Running generators in parallel; balancing; transmission line arrangements.-To maintain synchronism between two generating stations (A, B) connected together by a transmission line 1500 miles or more long upon station B being suddenly overloaded, an alternator, normally floating on the bus-bars at B and coupled to a heavy fly-wheel, supplies additional current to the bus-bars during overload for the small fraction of a second required for extra power to arrive from A. The alternator and fly-wheel are driven by a small synchronous motor from the bus-bars of station B. The line is preferably set up as in Specification 459,121 and includes the emergency boosters described in Specification 561,775 so that the fly-wheel alternator has to supply the additional load for only about 0.06-0.08 second. A further supply of synchronizing power may be provided by a second fly-wheel alternator automatically switched on to the bus-bars at B when their voltage falls below that of the ' floating ' alternator by a predetermined amount. The ' floating ' machine G, Fig. 3, is connected to the bus-bars RB at station B through the primary winding of a transformer so connected that the line current IL traverses the primary and secondary windings P, S in opposite directions. On overload, the balance between primary and secondary currents is upset due to current supplied by G through P and, in consequence, the secondary winding injects a leading quadrature boost into the line circuit. A condenser C may shunt the primary winding to cancel the internal reactance drop in the generator to permit the latter to discharge heavily under over load and the discharge may be further increased by arranging for the generator voltage to lead normally the voltage of the bus-bars RB. According to the Provisional Specification the connection between the fly-wheel alternator and its motor may be through a pawl or the equivalent which, during overload, permits the motor to move ' backwards ' in relation to the alternator."

In a conveyer system of the kind in which goods can be despatched along an endless conveyer in association with selector devices which are set to correspond with the setting of one of a number of reader mechanisms disposed at particular stations along the conveyers to deliver the goods at predetermined stations, each reader mechanism has means for magnetically attracting a passing selector device into sensing position relatively to the reader mechanism. As shown, the selector devices 8 are as described in Specification 814,873, having two slidable selector elements 9, 10 mounted in a housing 8 and adjustable by wheels 11, 12. Each selector housing 8 is carried on a stem 7 from which the goods are suspended. The stem 7 has an enlargement at its upper end which may be engaged in a socket formed in a coupling piece 6 depending from a conveyer chain 1, and being retained in this socket by a pivoted catch 4 urged by a spring 5. Each reader mechanism includes a pair of discs 15, 16 loosely mounted on a shaft 17 secured between top and bottom plates 28, 29 of the reader housing. These discs are spaced by a sleeve 20 secured on the shaft 17 so that they lie in the planes of the elements 9, 10, respectively, of a passing selector device. The discs are held resiliently against opposite ends of the sleeve 20 by collars 19 acted on by springs 17. Each disc includes a finger 23 disposed in the path of the corresponding selector element, and a.sector-shaped part 21 provided with a notch 22. As an index device passes the reader mechanism the discs are rotated by respective amounts according to the degree of projection of each of the selector elements 9, 10. The notches 22 on the two discs are positioned such that upon passage of an appropriately set index device the rotation of the discs will bring the notches in the two discs into alignment with a strip 24 depending from a plate 25 pivoted by a sleeve 26 on a shaft 27 fixed between the plates 28 and 29. A pair of vertically spaced studs 31 disposed in a web 30 integral with the sleeve 26 are in contact with spring-loaded plungers 32 of a pair of microswitches 33 connected in series, whereby the plate 24 is urged towards the discs. On passage of an index device set for that particular station the strip 24 will therefore enter the aligned notches 22 and operate -the micro-switches which operate a relay 34 controlling discharge mechanism for the goods. Each selector device is guided accurately past the reader mechanism by the engagement of a pair of steel rollers 13, 14 on the stem 7 with the edges of T-shaped magnetized plates 47, 48. A magnetic circuit is completed through the plates 47, 48, the rollers 13, 14 and the stem 7 by a steel pillar 50 bolted between the plates 47, 48. The leading and trailing ends of the plates 47, 48 are tapered to give a gradually reducing magnetic flux towards these ends, the leading ends also being inclined away from the paths of the rollers 13, 14 to receive these rollers smoothly. Just prior to passing the sensing position the roller 13 engages the inclined end 46 of a forwardly projecting extension 45 of the plate 25, pivoting the latter so as to move the strip 24 clear of the discs 15, 16. Just prior to this a roller 38 on the stem 7 engages a roller on the end of an arm 36 carried outside the reader housing on the end of a shaft 35 journalled in the plates 28 and 29, rotating this shaft. Ar arm 39 carried on the shaft 35 within the reader housing engages a roller 40 on the extension 45 of plate 25 to pivot the latter whereby strip 24 is moved to release the discs, and simultaneously a spring wire frame 43 carried by the shaft 35 is urged against the discs to rotate them from a previous setting, if any, to the initial position shown where they engage a stop 44. As the stem 7 moves further along the conveyer, the discs are rotated by engagement of the selector elements with the fingers 23 while the strip 24 is held out of the way by the roller 13 engaging the plate 25. When plate 25 is released from the roller 13 the strip 24 is free to enter the notches 22, if aligned therewith, as described above. Specification 801,179 also is referred to."

If there is insufficient zinc sulphate to convert all the cadmium to sulphate, zinc sulphate may be added. After this first heat treatment, the material may be heated to above 700 DEG C. (decomposition temperature of zinc sulphate) and below 827 DEG C. (decomposition temperature of cadmium sulphate) to convert any remaining zinc sulphate to the oxide. The product may be leached to recover the cadmium sulphate. Any ferric sulphate present in the original dust is converted to the oxide by the heating. Copper, aluminium, and arsenic are also rendered insoluble."

Operating and controlling barriers electrically. -In a semi-automatic electrically-actuated apparatus for the unloading of trucks, in which a series of motors 1 - - 8 are arranged to effect a series of operations in sequence, and the controlling circuits for the various operations are interlocked and fitted with various limit controls so that one operation must be completed before the succeeding operation is commenced, and yet tne controlling systems are sufficiently elastic to permit of the stoppage of the sequence of operations at the end of any individual operation that may have failed to secure the desired result and allow of the continuing of the sequence from that point onwards, after the repetition of the unsatisfactory individual operation, two of the series of motors are used to raise planks which block a door opening, after the door itself has been opened manually. The planks in question are raised by motors 5 and 6. Motor 5 slides a studded buffer horizontally until the studs stick in the planks, and motor 6 elevates the buffer to raise the planks sufficiently for the load to drop out underneath them. The two motors are controlled by master switches 43, 44 which energize other starting and controlling switches. When the masterswitch 43 is moved to its 'forward' position the starting-switch 15 is energized to start the motor 5, but neither the switch 15, nor the switch 16 referred to hereinafter, can be energized to start the motors 5, 6 unless each of the starting switches 13, 14, 19, used in connection with that operation, has been closed and afterwards re-opened by its respective overload relays, and unless other master-switches 41, 42 are set in their forward operating positions. The buffer having been positioned, and the masterswitch 43 returned to ' off ' position, the raising of the planks is proceeded with by moving the master-switch 44 to its forward position to start the motor 6. This energizes switch 16, which, in closing, causes an auxiliary switch in mechanical connection therewith, to complete the motor circuit. The motor raises the verticallymoving buffer to an upper limit at which a switch automatically de-energizes and reopens the switch 16. Should the buffer prove to be positioned improperly for raising the planks, the master-switch then can be moved to ' reverse ' position for lowering it again, until, at the lower limit, another switch cuts out the motor 6. The buffer arm then can be re-positioned, by further actuation of the motor 5, before the motor 6 is operated again to raise it."

647,1593402,20963164,"Halogen-free polymerizable compounds are prepared by reacting with an aqueous solution of a hydrosulphide of an alkali-metal on a monohalogen substituted aliphatic ketone or on a dihalogen substituted aliphatic ketone in which the halogens are attached to different carbon atoms and are in the alpha or beta position to the carbonyl group, said halogen being chlorine, bromine or iodine. The products are stated to be novel mono- or di-mercapto-ketones and are formed as monomers or low molecular weight addition polymers, i.e. containing not more than four units. The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a water-immiscible inert organic liquid whereby the mercaptoketones are removed from the sphere of reaction as soon as they are formed, so avoiding thio-ether formation; the latter may also be avoided by lowering the temperature and/or increasing the pressure at which reaction is effected. The monomeric mercapto-ketones form the addition polymers on standing; thus, mono- or di-mercapto acetone in benzene deposits a dimeric addition polymer of the mercapto-ketone. The low molecular weight addition polymers of di-mercaptoacetone are converted to the monomeric form on warming with dilute acid. The monomeric mono- and di-mercapto ketones and their low molecular weight addition polymers are converted into condensation polymers by effecting auto-condensation in the presence of an acid-reacting condensation catalyst comprising dry hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid containing not more than 20 per cent by weight of water, or a Friedel-Crafts catalyst, or in the presence of an excess of an oxidising agent, for example, iodine. The mercapto-ketones may be partially oxidised using an amount of oxidising agent which is less than that molecularly equivalent to the mercapto-ketone and then polymerized as above. The fusible polymers may be moulded, for example, in the form of threads and then further polymerized. The solubility characteristics of the polymers may be altered by treatment with aqueous acid permanganate. In examples: (1) monomeric dimercapto acetone is prepared by shaking a benzene solution of sym.-dichloracetone with an aqueous solution of sodium hydrosulphide for two minutes with cooling, extracting the benzene layer with aqueous trisodium phosphate so obtaining an aqueous solution of the sodium salt of the mercapto-ketone which is mixed with benzene and sodium dihydrogen phosphate to give a benzene solution of dimercaptoacetone, which is isolated as a viscous oil on distilling off the solvent; (2) a low molecular weight addition polymer of dimercapto-acetone is prepared by the procedure of (1) above, the period of shaking being 15 mins. whereupon colourless crystals of the polymer separate; (3) the procedure of (2) is repeated, the mixture being seeded or allowed to stand for 16 hours; (4) the polymer of (2) above is prepared by adding lumps of fused dichloracetone to aqueous sodium hydrosulphide with shaking at below 5 DEG C., the crystalline polymer then separating out on standing; the addition polymer is depolymerized (a) by warming with N-sulphuric acid or (b) melting with a solid mixture of phosphoric acid and potassium dihydrogen phosphate; (5) a low molecular weight polymer of mono-mercaptoacetone is prepared by shaking a benzene solution of monochloracetone with aqueous sodium hydrosulphide; the product is believed to undergo a cis-trans conversion on treatment with concentrated aqueous hydrochloric acid or a mixture of glacial acetic and sulphuric acids; (6) mercaptomethyl b -mercaptoethyl ketone is prepared by shaking chlormethyl b -chloroethyl ketone with aqueous sodium hydrosulphide; (7) the addition polymer of dimercapto acetone is melted and gaseous hydrochloric acid bubbled through yielding a fusible resin capable of being drawn into threads; (8) the addition polymer of mercaptoacetone is converted into an infusible resin with 98 per cent sulphuric acid; (9) the depolymerized product of 4 (b) is extracted with benzene and the solution treated with 80 per cent sulphuric acid; the white powdery precipitate is rendered a water-soluble polymer by treatment with acid permanganate; (10) the product of (5) is converted into a rubbery mass by means of 98 per cent sulphuric acid and on kneading with boiling water forms a mass capable of being drawn into threads; (11) the product of (6) is converted into a red resin by 98 per cent sulphuric acid and is also capable of being drawn into threads."

[Class 37] Two coils are arranged one inside the other with their axes perpendicular and a thin sheet of high permeability ferromagnetic material is disposed in both coils ; alternating current is supplied to one coil and a current is induced in the other coil by a magnetic field component parallel with its axis, the induced current being measured by phase-sensitive means. As shown, in Fig. 1, a magnetizing coil a is wound about an axis parallel to the co-ordinate axis O, Y, and a pick-up coil b is wound about an axis parallel to the co-ordinate axis O, X, and is enclosed within the coil a. A thin flat sheet c of ferromagnetic nickel iron alloy is arranged within both coils a, b. When the coils are placed in a steady magnetic field in the direction O, X, parallel with the axis of the pick-up coil b and the coil a is fed with A.C. from a source d so that the permeability of the nickel iron alloy in the direction O, X is reduced nearly to unity, the coil b has induced in it a voltage which is a function of the intensity of the magnetic component parallel to the axis of the coil b. When the steady magnetic field is in the direction O, Y, i.e. parallel with the axis of the magnetizing coil a, the output of the coil b is zero. The pick-up coil b is applied through an amplifier to a phasesensitive rectifier. The frequency of the output being double that of the source d, a phase reference system in shunt from the source d is fed through a frequency doubler to the phasesensitive rectifier, the output from which is measured by a centre-zero galvanometer. A reaction coil may be arranged coaxial with the pick-up coil b and in series with the galvanometer so as to generate a magnetic field in opposition to the component of the magnetic field being measured. In a modification, Fig. 4, the magnetically responsive unit consists of a tube g with a thin wall h of high permeability nickel iron alloy, a toroidal magnetizing coil a, and a pick-up coil b wound in the form of a solenoid across the turns of the coil a. Two such tubes may be arranged with their axes parallel and their pick-up coils in series, a single magnetizing coil being wound through the bores of both tubes. As shown in Fig. 7, two magnetically responsive units a, b, c and a1, b1, c1 are arranged with the axes of the pick-up coils b, b1 at right angles to one another in the same plane. The magnetizing coils a, a1 are connected in series with an A.C. source d, and the outputs of the pick-up coils b, b1 are fed to phase-sensitive amplifiers l12 the sine and cosine currents produced by which are converted to potentials by being passed through resistances and supplied to the two pairs of plates p, n of a cathode-ray oscillograph q. The deflection of the spot from its central position indicates the magnitude and direction of the field. In another arrangement the sine and cosine currents are fed to a selfsynchronized remote indicator with a polarised rotor r, Fig. 8, a coil n1 in series with the reaction coil o, and a coil p1 in series with the reaction coil o1. In a modification the rotor r is replaced by a movable coil fed from a frequency doubler."

A visual indicator on an aircraft includes at least two individual indicators each arranged to indicate a different occurrence, and a common indicator arranged to indicate any one of the occurrences. There may also be means operative only after one of the occurrences for rendering the common indicator incapable of further indicating that occurrence but capable of indicating any other of the occurrences. In Fig. 1, a plurality of fault relay switches 20A, 20B, ... 20F are connected to a positive line 19 and over lines 21A, 21B ... 21F to corresponding indicator lamps 23A, 23B ... 23F having a common earth lead 24. Each line 21A, 21B ... 21F is connected through a rectifier such as 39A and relay contacts such as 40A, 41A to a common line 42 connected to a flasher unit 44 comprising a bi-metallic contact 51 and heater element 52. The flasher unit controls the operation of an indicator lamp 55 and an acoustic horn 56. Each relay such as 45A is strong enough when energized to hold its armature 41A in a contact breaking position against a spring 46A, but is not strong enough to move the armature from the contact making to the contact breaking position. To render the lamps dim or bright for day or night operation, a resistor 26 may be inserted into or shorted out from the earth line 24 according as one or other coil 28 or 29 of an electromagnet is energized by an armature 34 making contact 33 or 32 respectively. The resistance of resistor 26 varies with the current so as to tend to keep the lamps at a given illumination irrespective of how many are energized. Fig. 2 shows the indicator face, the lamps such as 23A being mounted behind windows 14 marked with the corresponding fault and surrounding a knob 13 which is rotatable to rotate the switch armature 34, Fig. 1, and houses lamp 55. The knob is also linked to a ring contact 48, connected to the positive line 19, and the knob and ring can be pressed inwardly, the ring making contacts 22A, 22B ... 22F to light all the lamps 23A, 23B ... 23F, and also pushing all the relay armatures such as 41A to the contact breaking position. In operation, if a fault develops, the appropriate contact, say contact 20A, is closed, lighting the lamp 23A and energizing the relay 45A which however is not strong enough to break contacts 40A, 41A. The flasher unit 44 is energized through rectifier 39A, rectifiers 39B ... 39F preventing energization of the other indicator circuits. Flasher unit 44 energizes lamp 55 and horn 56, the intermittent operation of which attracts the pilots' attention. He then presses knob 13, and contact 48 makes contacts 22A ... 22F, lighting all the lamps, and pushes all the armatures 41A ... 41F to the contact breaking position. On releasing the knob, only armature 41A is retained in the contact breaking position and only lamp 23A remains lit, coil 45A being energized. The lamp 55 and horn 56 are cut off, and since contacts 40A, 41A are open, cannot be re-operated by the same fault until line 21A is cleared by rectification of the fault, but are available to be operated by any different fault. The lamps 23A ... 23F can be rested by pressing knob 13, when they are energized by contact 48."

[Class 80(ii)] In a shaft coupling transmitting end thrust and radial loads as well as torque, axially mating toothed driving members mounted on each shaft can be drivingly engaged and locked against disengagement only when the shafts have been themselves locked together by passing the slotted enlarged end of an axial extension on one shaft axially through complementary slots into a co-acting recess in the other shaft end and turning the shafts relatively to each other to a locking position. As shown, applied to couple together the turbine and compressor shafts of an aircraft jet engine, an externally toothed wheel 20, Fig. 1, fixed on one shaft 14, is engageable by an internally toothed collar 21, slidably splined on the other shaft 11, only when a cylinder or ball 12, formed on the end of the shaft 11 and having three circumferentially spaced 60 degrees slots 13, has been passed through a complementarily slotted cover plate 16 into a co-acting socket 15 in the end of the shaft 14 and turned through 60 degrees to prevent withdrawal. Prior engagement of the toothed members is prevented by three enlarged tooth spaces 24, Fig. 4, on the collar 21, which mate with correspondingly enlarged teeth on the wheel 20 only when locking is complete. Further locking of the collar 21 against axial movement is provided by a locating ring 26, Fig. 5, also slidably splined on the shaft 11 and which, when the collar 21 is drivingly engaged and teeth 27 on the ring have been passed through slots 29 on the collar 21, can be rotated in a groove 30 in the shaft 11 until a radial spring-pressed plunger 32 in the collar 21 enters one of two holes 31 in the ring thus locating it axially by interference of its splines with those of the shaft 11.

[Class 92 (ii)] Feed assisting means for the belt feed mechanism of a gun comprises a continuously running motor, sprockets over which the belt passes and clutch elements between the motor and sprockets adapted to be brought into engagement by the rocking of pivoted arms in contact with the belt, these arms being independent of the sprockets and being mounted to rock about their pivots when the tension of the belt exceeds a predetermined value. On a decrease in the tension, the clutch elements separate and the belt is fed to the gun by mechanism within the gun independently of the motor. In the construction shown, a shaft 8 carrying a clutch member 7A is' continuously driven by an electric motor in a casing 1, and a second shaft 9 carrying a clutch member 7B is geared, through reduction gearing to a shaft carrying sprockets 6A over which the ammunition belt passes. Member 7A has a conical face forming one race of a ball bearing 12 whose other race is formed by a ring 14 in the clutch housing 3. Member 7B also has a conical face forming one race of a ball bearing 11 whose other race is formed by a non-rotatable annular ring 16 which can be depressed against the action of springs 18. The two members 7A, 7B are normally kept apart by a spring-pressed ball 10B, the spring of which bears on a floating phosphor bronze disc on member 7A. On a shaft 19 are two arms 20 whose outer ends bear against the underside of the belt and whose upward movements are limited by pins 26 which engage in slots in the sprockets. Each arm carries a rod 22 which bears on the ring 16. When the feeding mechanism associated with the gun is set in operation, the motor is also started, and if the tension on belt remains below a predetermined value the feeding mechanism alone suffices to feed the belt over the sprockets, from which the belt is gradually lifted by a leaf spring 23. When, however, the tension increases beyond that value, the belt depresses arms 20 causing rods 22 to depress the ring 16, the ring in turn serving to cause clutch member 7B to engage member 7A. The motor then assists in the feeding of the belt and when the tension is again reduced below the given value, the springs 17, by lifting ring 16, will disengage the clutch and restore the arms 20 to the position shown."

[Class 80(iv)] [Also in Group XVI]' Escapement mechanism comprises a disc mounted on a shaft, and a pair of clutches, one fixed and the other movable about the shaft axis, arranged to cooperate independently with the disc, the extent of movement of the movable clutch being infinitely variable within predetermined maximum and minimum limits to enable the shaft to be released for corresponding infinitely adjustable movements. As employed for effecting variable letter-spacing movement of a typewriter carriage, a rack 42, Fig. 1, on the carriage 12 engages a pinion 43 on a shaft 44 carrying the control disc 50. Each typelever 14 is formed with a cam surface 27 which, as the type 15 nears the platen 11 engages a universal bail 26 fixed to a plate 28 so as to move the latter rearwardly against the action of a spring 39. A yoke 34 pivoted at 83 supports the rear end 33 of the plate. Movement of the plate actuates the clutches as described below. The fixed clutch comprises balls 51, Fig. 8, supported between inclined faces on a fixed member 52 and the disc, the balls being seated in holes in a yoke 54 carried by a lever 55 pulled downwardly by a spring 57 so as to cause the balls to grip the disc 50 and prevent its rotation and therefore stop movement of the carriage. A link 59 pivoted at 33 to the plate 28 and supported by a link 61 carries a cone-ended screw 58 which normally engages a roller 60 on the yoke 54 to raise the latter and free the clutch. As the plate 28 moves rearwardly, the screw 58 moves from beneath the roller 60 and allows the clutch to lock the disc 50 against rotation. The movable clutch consists of balls 72, Figs. 6 and 7, mounted between inclined faces 73 on a stirrup 70, 71 pivoted on the shaft 44 and movable between stops 90, 92, a spring 103, Fig. 5, (not shown) tending to hold the stirrup against the stop 92. As shown, the stop 90 is fixed and the stop 92 is carried by a pivoted member 93 adjustable by a screwed spindle 98. Pivoted at 75 on the stirrup 70 is an inner stirrup 74, having apertures to accommodate the balls 72 and urged by a spring 76 in a direction to cause the balls to bind on the disc 50. As the plate 28 moves rearwardly, an arm 82 thereon engages a spring strip 80 so as to move two balls 78 towards the disc 50. The inner ball is seated in an aperture in the stirrup 74 and rises on an inclined surface 79 on the disc hub to move the stirrup and release the clutch. When the cam 27 begins to act on the bail 26, the fixed clutch 51 locks the disc 50 and the movable clutch 72 is released as described above, the latter moving under spring action against the adjustable stop 92. After printing has taken place and the type lever 14 moves away from the platen, the plate 28 moves forwardly so that the clutch 51 is released and the clutch 72 allowed to operate. The carriage-control spring which is sufficiently strong to overcome the effect of the spring attached to the stirrup 70, then turns the disc 50 carrying the stirrup 70 with it until the latter engages the stop 90. This constitutes one letter-spacing movement and completes one cycle of operations. The extent of the spacing thus is determined by the adjustment of the stop 92."

Fig. 6 shows a control unit consisting of a switch having two fixed contacts 75 between which is a movable contact 80 carried by a spring tongue 81. The movable contact normally rests against one of the fixed contacts as shown in Fig. 6 and can be moved to a central position between the two contacts or into engagement with the second fixed contact by means of a rocking lever 70 carrying a roller 85 which engages a cam on a cam assembly 10, Fig. 7, rotated by the timing mechanism. The parts of the control unit are mounted in a recessed moulding 9 a side view of which is shown in Fig. 5. The fixed contacts 75 are carried by metal strips 76 which are bent over ribs 73 on the moulding and carry lugs 78 to which leads are attached. The movable contact is connected to a lead 57 through the spring 81. In order to ensure correct engagement of the control units with one another and with the base block they are formed with projections 61, 68 which engage in corresponding recesses in the base block and adjacent units. The cam mechanism for actuating the lever 70 may be as described in Specification 594,974 and the timing mechanism as described in Specification 594,975. Specification 594,972 also is referred to."

[Class 38(v)] [Also in Group XXIX] Cams on a shaft for actuating control elements such as the movable contacts of a time switch are provided with indentations engaging splines on the shaft to enable the cams to be adjusted angularly relatively to one another to produce a predetermined sequence of operations of the control elements. Fig. 3 shows a cam assembly with three cams 102 for use in a time switch as described in Specifications 594,972, 594,973 and 594,975, the cam shaft being shown in Fig. 6 and one form of cam in Fig. 12. The cams are provided with a central opening 103 having a number of indentations corresponding to splines 87d formed on one half of the shaft whereby the cams can be slid on to the shaft in various angular positions, a positive drive between the shaft and cams being provided in all positions of the cams. The cams are formed with rises 104 and troughs 106 which cause the switch contacts to assume their extreme positions as described in Specification 594,973. An intermediate step 105 may be provided to place the contacts in a central position. The number of splines on the shaft is equal to or a multiple of the number of rises on the cams.

The plate 1 is attached to a support 13 which is shaped to provide sufficient space between the plate 1 and the back of the casing to accommodate timing elements of different sizes as described in Specification 594,972. Fig. 3 is a front view of the plate 1 with the actuating mechanism and support 8 for the switch units and Fig. 23 is an exploded view of the actuating mechanism, support 13 and cam assembly 10. Rocking levers 115, 116 adapted to be moved by the hands of the timing element or clock and a lever 117 for manual operation by a test-button 21, Fig. 3, are mounted on a common pivot pin 91a on the plate 1 and are connected by springs 119 to a post 118. The forward ends of the levers 115, 116 extend radially in front of an arcuate gap 6 in the plate 1, the lever 117 being cut off short of the gap. On the lower end of each lever 115, 116, 117 is pivoted a pawl 126 which engages a ratchet wheel on the cam assembly, the pawl on the manually operated lever 117 being held by a spring 127 in engagement with the wheel 92 and the pawls on the levers 115, 116 engaging the wheels 96, 97. Further pawls 130 are mounted on the lower ends of levers 115, 116 and are connected by springs 129 to the pawls 126. On the pivot pin 91a are also mounted two blocking levers 121 the ends 121a of which rest on projections 128 extending from the pawls 126. Springs 125 anchor the levers 121 to the post 118. Two selector discs 133, 134, Figs. 3 and 23, are provided which can be pre-set to vary the sequence of operations to be performed by the actuating mechanism. The discs are rotatably mounted on a pillar 131 on the plate 1 and are radially divided into seven equal sectors each of which is provided with three equally spaced screw-threaded apertures 135. Each disc has secured to its underside a ratchet wheel 136 having twenty-one teeth and which is engaged by one of the pawls 130. The discs are angularly movable relatively to one another and one may be advanced relatively to the other by one, two or three steps each step corresponding to one tooth space of the wheels 136. When one disc has been advanced three steps relatively to the other further movement of the disc results in both discs moving together. The pawls 130 are prevented from moving laterally out of engagement with their ratchet wheels by guard discs 141 and spring spiders 137 having pins 139 which engage apertures 140 in the guard discs. In the normal position of the mechanism the pawls 126 on the levers 115, 116 are kept disengaged from the ratchet wheels 96, 97 of the cam assembly by the engagement of the projections 128 and lever ends 121a. In this position the blocking levers 121 rest with their ends 123 over the edges of the selector discs 133, 134 and in the path of the apertures 135. The timing element rocks the levers 115, 116 at predetermined intervals but while the pawls 126 are kept out of engagement with the ratchet wheels 96, 97 by the ends 121a of the blocking levers 121 no movement is imparted to the cam assembly. A series of screw-threaded studs is provided any of which can be fitted into any of the apertures in the selector discs. When one of these studs reaches the corresponding blocking lever end 123 the lever is rotated on its pivot sufficiently to raise its other end 121a and allow the pawl 126 to rise into engagement with its ratchet wheel 96 or 97 on the cam assembly. A rocking movement imparted by the clock hands to the levers 115, 116 rotates the corresponding selector disc by the pawl 130 through an angle corresponding to one tooth of the wheel 136 which is the same as the spacing between adjacent apertures in the selector discs. In the example shown in Fig. 3 each sector of the disc 133 corresponds to a day of the week and each aperture in the sector bears an identification symbol. The discs are fixed rotatably on the'pillar 131, Fig. 23, by a screw and disc 143 carrying an index 145. The clock dial 45 carries six hands which can be secured in any position round the dial, three of the hands marked ' ON ' of which one is shown in Fig. 3, operating on the lever 116, and three ' OFF ' hands operating on the lever 115. The series of switching operations can be varied by altering the number of switch or control units 9 and varying their connections, by using different cams 102 arranged in various ways on the shaft 87 and varying the setting of the hands on the clock dial and the studs in the selector discs. The Specification describes the settings required for one particular sequence of operations."

The lamp housing has inner reflecting surfaces and contains an axially adjustable reflector 27, an electric light bulb 32 whose support 31 is adjustable in a lateral extension 30 of the housing, and a condenser system 22 supported in a tube 21 which is slidable in the tube 19 and has a pin 23 engaging a V-shaped slot in the tube 19 so that, by manipulating the pin, the condenser is both reciprocated and rotated in order, it is stated, to improve the character of the projected image. Diametrically opposed peep-holes 34 provided in the lamp housing assist in centring the lamp. The lamp housing is carried by a tubular arm of cruciform shape so that it may be adjustably mounted on a vertical pillar 43, supported, if desired, by a ball joint, on a base 44 which may be provided with levelling screws. The limb 36, 38 encircles the pillar as shown when the apparatus is used for enlarging, and the limb 35, 37 is used for projection, both limbs being slit and provided with clamping screws. The lamp supply cable 45 passes down the centre of the pillar. The Provisional Specification describes a construction in which the lamp housing is partspherical and is silvered to serve as the reflector ; and in which the apparatus is supported for enlarging by two arms slidable on a vertical pillar, one secured to the side of the camera and the other to the lamp housing, and is supported for projection on the top of the pillar which is screw-threaded to engage a boss on the bottom of the camera body."
680,1593455,20968378,"594,634. Electric discharge apparatus; radiolocation. COLLARD, J. Jan. 20, 1941, No. 775. [Classes 39 (i) and 40 (v)] [Also in Group XXXVI] .Apparatus for detecting the presence of a moving object comprises means for transmitting oscillatory signalsat spaced time intervals and means for receiving these signals after reflection by the object. In order to distinguish signals reflected by the moving object from signals reflected by stationary objects, means are provided to convert into amplitude changes the phase changes which occur between successive signals reflected from the moving object by virtue of its movement and oscillations bearing a fixed relationship with the signals transmitted. As applied for detecting the presence of aircraft, a carrier wave having a frequency of 100 megacycles per second is modulated by short pulses of 2 microseconds duration occurring every 1300 microseconds. These signals are transmitted from a directive aerial and after reflection are received, amplified, and fed to a cathode-ray tube. A receiver 3, Fig. 1, produces output signals, the amplitudes of which are dependent on the phase difference between the transmitted and received signals. The output of the receiver is fed in succession to a series of condensers 4, one of the electrodes of each condenser being connected together and earthed through a common resistance 5. Signals appearing across this resistance are passed through an amplifier 6 to a cathode-ray oscillograph 7, the beam of which is traversed at a predetermined rate across the screen. As the beam commences to travel across the screen, a switch arm 8 commences to traverse the series of condenser contacts. At the end of their travel, the beam and the switch arm are simultaneously returned to their starting points to recommence the cycle. As the cycle is commenced, a signal is transmitted and the received reflected signal is applied to the condenser in contact with the switch arm at that instant, so that a charge accumulates on the condenser depending on the amplitude of the signal in the output of the receiver. If a reflected pulse is received from a stationary object the voltage produced at the output of the receiver will be the same as at the corresponding instant on the previous cycle and no additional charge is applied to the appropriate condenser. No current therefore flows through the resistance 5 and the cathode-ray is not deflected. If received signal is reflected by a moving object the voltages at corresponding instants in successive cycles will differ, so that current flows into or out of the appropriate condenser through the resistance 5 and causes a vertical deflection of the beam of the oscillograph. The switching is performed electronically as shown in Fig. 2. In an evacuated envelope is a cathode-ray gun 9 generating a beam of electrons which is deflected so that it impinges in turn on a series of conducting elements 10 mounted on a sheet of mica 11 backed by a conducting plate 12. The elements 10 are of material that emits secondary electrons under bombardment by a beam of primary electrons and form a series of condensers in association with the plates 11, 12. The elements 10 may be arranged in a circle, the cathode-ray beam being deflected by a rotating field. In front of the elements 10 is a grid 13 to which the output of the receiver 3 is connected. The plate 12 is earthed through a resistance 5 and connected to the amplifier 6. As the beam impinges on the elements 10 in turn, each element emits secondary electrons which are repelled or attracted by the grid 13, causing the individual condensers to charge or discharge and producing a voltage across the resistance 5 if the charge across one condenser differs from what it was in the previous cycle. An initial vertical deflection is given to the beam of the oscillograph simultaneously with the transmission of the signal, and the screen is provided with a scale, the position on which of the trace due to the reflection of the signal indicates the distance of the object. To reduce the effect of the capacity between the grid 13 and plate 12, the capacity between element 10 and the plate 12 is made large compared with that between the grid 13 and plate 10. Alternatively, or in addition, the plate 12 may be fed from the receiver 3 through a condenser with a voltage in opposite phase to the voltage applied to the grid 13."

In an automatic adjusting device for a brake, e.g. a disc brake having a rotatable disc 1 and two pressure plates 2 and 3 pivoted at 2b and 3b to a non-rotatable member (not shown); the apices 2c and 3c of the pressure plates projecting beyond the outer periphery of the disc 1, rotation of arm 16 by a cable or other means (not shown) rotates an operating rod 11 provided with a coarse-pitch thread 20 at one end and a fine-pitch oppositelythreaded portion 13 at the other end to move rod relative to a coarsethreaded part-spherical member 6 housed in a part-spherical recess 2d in pressure plate 2 to draw pressure plates 2 and 3 together until hreaded member 6 abuts circular clip 21 whereby the clearances 26 of the brake are taken up. Continued rotation of arm 16 causes member 6 to rotate in its recess 2d without further relative movement between the operating rod 11 and member 6 taking place. During the time operating rod 11 is moved relatively to member 6, nut 14 is brought into abutment with the planar side 7a of a keyed part-spherical member 7 housed in an associated recess in pressure plate 3. Continued rotation of arm 16 causes relative movement to take place between nut 14 and the fine-pitch threaded portion 13 of operating rod 11 to effect further movement urging the pressure plates together. The brake is disengaged by releasing the tension in the cable or like means such that the arm 16 is returned to the position illustrated by spring means (not shown); the coarsethreaded portion 20 of the rod 11 unscrewing to a position in which the circular spring clip 22 is once again abutting the planar side 6a of the threaded member 6. As the friction pads 4 and 5 wear, the nut 14 progressively moves along the fine-pitch threaded portion 13 of rod 11. such that the nut 14 finishes up in a position very slightly further along the rod 11 to automatically compensate for wear during each application of the brake."

[Classes 40 (iii) and 40 (v)] A balanced bridge composed of four quarterwave transmission lines serves to connect two aerial arrays to two senders or receivers in such a way that two different polar diagrams are alternately effective ; or to two receivers whose demodulated outputs are combined in opposition to give the effect of a narrow beam. In a radar aerial system two arrays A1, A2 and A4, A5, are connected to opposite corners B, D of a network composed of quarter-wave lines, and the legs are crossed at E to give a reversal of phase. The corner E is connected to a feeder Q, and the remaining corner C to a feeder P and a central aerial A3. The system is so dimensioned that power from the feeder P, when the system is used for sending, reaches all the aerials in equal amplitude and phase, but owing to the crossing of the legs of E, power from the feeder Q reaches the arrays A1, A2, and A4, A5 in antiphase and does not reach the aerial A3. The resulting polar diagrams are complementary to one another, Fig. 4 (not shown). The impedance presented to the feeder P is independent of that presented to the feeder Q, provided that the system is symmetrical. When the system is used for receiving, two receivers are connected to the transmission lines P, Q, and their demodulated outputs may be combined in opposition, Fig. 2 (not shown), the effective beam-width being thereby reduced in the resultant polar diagram, Fig. 6 (not shown) ; for instance when the invention is applied to a radar system of the kind described in Specification 582,494, so as to narrow the indications on the cathode-ray tube of the bearing indicator and to reduce noise as a result of the resultant demodulated signal giving off bearing. The 5-bay in-phase aerial system may be used in the radar sender, and the overall polar diagram for this combination is given in Fig. 8 (not shown). Alternatively the line Q may be connected to the sender and one receiver while the other receiver is connected to the line Q, a protective transmitter-receiver switching device of the kind described in Specification 583,743 being provided. In a friend-or-foe interrogator system of the kind described in Specification 585,347 the invention may be used to eliminate off-bearing responses. In a common-aerial system the invention may be used in conjunction of a transmitter-receiver switch and a balanceto-unbalance matching device for combining the high-frequency outputs of the lines P, Q, Fig. 3 (not shown).

[Also in Group XXXVIII] In a system in which the pilot valve in a bypass system associated with a centrifugal pump is adjusted in accordance with the difference between the inlet and outlet fluid temperatures, temperature-sensitive resistors are included in a bridge circuit the output of which controls a trigger circuit to operate relay means which in turn opens the said pilot valve when the said temperature exceeds a predetermined value. In Fig. 1 temperature-sensitive resistors DRT and SRT are included in the arms of a bridge circuit B the output from which when large enough causes moving-coil polarized relay L1 to close magnetic contacts S 1. This in turn shortcircuits the coil of the normally energized relay L3 which then falls out, removes coil L1 from the output circuit of the bridge, switches the line supply from ' by-pass discharge pipe closed ' indicator V7 to the ' by-pass discharge pipe open ' indicator V8, de-energizes relay L4 and switches in an alarm circuit AS. The deenergization of L4 opens the circuit which normally holds the pilot valve closed. The manual closure of switches S2A and S2B (normally biased towards the position shown) resets relay L1 by means of coil L2 and reenergizes relay L3. A switch S3 (normally biased towards the closed position) is provided so that the pilot valve may be opened manually. In Fig. 2 the A.C. output from the bridge circuit controls the potential of the grid of valve V5 by means of amplifiers V1 and V2 and diode pump V3 and V4. When the signal from the bridge exceeds a predetermined value the grid of V5 becomes so negatively biased that the valve ceases to conduct sufficient current to hold relay L3 in and hence it falls out. The relay L3 functions in the same manner as it does in Fig. 1. This remark also applies to S3 and S2 which simply replaces the function of S2A and S2B. Under normal working conditions there is always some output from the bridge due to harmonic oscillations &c. and this results in a small output from the diode pump V3 and V4 sufficient to hold on relay S5 by means of a transistor amplifier V6. If for any reason current in the circuit falls to zero, switch S6 is opened and hence relay L3 is de-energized. Resistor R may be included in both circuits for control of the operating current set to the bridge and hence alter the temperature range over which the system is operable.

A method for correcting the tooth bearings on gears consists in running two gears together in mesh for a lapping operation, with provision for relative movement between them in the direction of the common pitch cone tangent of the meshing gears, and causing more material to be removed from specific flank zones and thereby displacing the tooth bearings as desired by exerting the pressure producing the flank thrust by driving that gear whose resultant tooth bearing when exerting pressure on the mating gear requires a displacement in the direction from the dedendum to the addendum. As described for the lapping together of two bevel gears 13, 14, Fig. 3, the gear 14 is journaled on a head 18 on a table 19 which is mounted for straight-line movement on a base 20. The table is secured on the base at four points 22<SP>1</SP> by ball-joint devices, Fig. 5 (not shown), providing sufficient play to permit straight-line movement between the table and base as determined by two straight guides 30. Each guide has a pivot 31, Fig. 6, fixed in a hollow cylinder 32 journalled for adjustment in the table 19 and is engaged by a pin 37 journalled in the base 20, and the two guides are connected by an endless band 33, Fig. 3, or linkage so that they can be adjusted in unison. The movement of the table on the guides 30 is effected against the action of springs 50, 51 by a cam 44 which is driven by a motor 41 and acts through a disc 48 upon a push rod 45 pivoted at 46 to the table ; pins 47 can be set to determine the extent of swinging movement of the push rod to either side of its mean position when the direction of rotation of the cam is reversed at each change of tooth profile abutment, i.e. at a change in the rotational direction of the gears 13, 14 or of the driving gear. The gear 13 is rotated by an electric motor through a pulley drive 15, and the gear 14 by another electric motor 60, Fig. 7, driving through an infinitelyvariable drive unit 59, pulley 17 and spring- pressed friction member 16, Fig. 8 ; the friction member 16, which like the pulley 17 is journalled on the spindle 52 of the gear 14, is urged against a face plate 58 keyed on the spindle. The friction member also drives through worm gearing a dial 67, Fig. 7 and the face plate similarly drives a pointer 71 moving over the dial. In operation, the guides 30 are set so as to be parallel with the common pitch cone tangent 72, Fig. 3, of the meshing gears, and the pressure producing the flank thrust is provided by that gear whose resultant tooth bearing is to be displaced towards the addendum, this effect being achieved by driving that gear at the higher speed by appropriate setting of the drive unit 59, the relative positions of the dial and pointer showing which gear is the source of pressure. The direction of rotation of the cam 44 is reversed at each change of rotational direction of the gears to be lapped or when there is a change in the drive. With the gears rotating always in the same direction, the opposite flanks of the teeth are operated upon by causing the two gears alternately to act as drivers. Modifications consist in providing hydraulic or electric control means to replace the mechanical drive unit 59, and mounting both gears on tables which are moved, as described for the table 19 along straight guides 30. Specification 817,491 is referred to."

706,1593494,20971282,"Oxidation and deterioration of petroleum hydrocarbon products is inhibited by incorporating therein a small quantity of the reaction product of sulphur and phosphorus, or of a phosphorus sulphide with or without either or both of sulphur and phosphorus, with a compound having the formula ArXMT where Ar is an aromatic or substituted aromatic nucleus, X is a non-metal of Group 6 of the periodic table, M is a divalent metal of Group 2 of the periodic table and T is OH or (OM)n XAr where n is O, 1 or 2. The aromatic nucleus may be benzene, biphenyl, naphthalene or anthracene and may contain substituents such as the alkyl, aryl, carboxyl, hydroxyl, alkoxy, sulphhydryl, nitro, esterified carboxyl, keto, amino, aldehydo, chlormethyl, aminomethyl, alkyl thiomethyl, alkyl xantho methyl, metal substituted carboxyl, metal substituted hydroxyl or sulphhydryl groups or the halogens. Thus, the compound to be phosphorized and sulphurized may have the formula RArXMT where R represents at least one alkyl group joined to the nucleus Ar, the sum total of carbon atoms in such groups being at least 5 and T being in this case OH or (OM)nXArR. In reacting the aromatic compound with sulphur and phosphorus, it may be treated first with one element and then with the other. The sulphurizing phosphorizing reaction may be effected by fusion. Other substances which may be present however during the reaction are solvents, particularly high boiling hydrocarbon solvents such as xylol or a petroleum fraction, higher alcohol anti-foaming agents such as stearyl, lauryl, cetyl or woolfat alcohol and olefinic materials such as tetraisobutylene, cracked gas or an unsaturated alcohol. Petroleum hydrocarbon products in which the sulphurized phosphorized compounds may be incorporated include crankcase lubricants, extreme pressure lubricants, engine flushing oils, industrial oils, general machinery oils, process oils, rust preventive compositions, greases, motor fuels, diesel fuels and kerosene. In the case of motor fuels containing tetraethyl lead or other anti-knock agents, the sulphurized phosphorized compounds serve not only as anti-oxidants for the fuel but also as stabilizers for the anti-knock agent itself. In addition to the sulphurized phosphorized compounds, other agents may be added to the petroleum hydrocarbon products such as dyes, pour depressors, heat thickened fatty oils, sulphurized fatty oils, organometallic compounds, metallic or other soaps, sludge dispersers, anti-oxidants, thickeners, viscosity index improvers, oiliness agents, resins, rubber, olefin polymers, voltolized fats, voltolized mineral oils, voltolized waxes, colloidal solids such as graphite or zinc oxide, and solvents and assisting agents such as esters, ketones, alcohols, aldehydes, and halogenated or nitrated compounds. Assisting agents which are particularly desirable are the higher alcohols such as octyl, lauryl, cetyl, stearyl, heptadecyl, oleyl, phenyloctyl or octadecyl benzyl alcohol, naphthenic alcohols, synthetic alcohols obtained by the oxidation of such petroleum hydrocarbons as paraffin wax of petrolatum, and alcohols isolated from natural products such as woolfat or sperm oil. The woolfat or sperm oil may also itself be used as an assisting agent. Where the sulphurized phosphorized compounds are incorporated in mineral lubricating oils, detergents such as metal soaps, metal phenates, metal alcoholates, metal phenol sulphides, metal organo phosphates, thiophosphates, phosphites or thiophosphites, metal sulphonates, metal thiocarbamates, and metal xanthates or thioxanthates may also be added. Specific detergents mentioned are barium tert.-octylphenol sulphide, cobalt tert.-amylphenol sulphide, calcium mahogany sulphonates, tin salt of wax alkylated phenol sulphide, strontium mahogany sulphonates, magnesium cetylphenate, nickel oleate, calcium dichlorostearate, aluminium-calcium mixed soap of fatty acids from oxidation of petroleum fractions, calcium isohexadecyl phenol sulphonate, barium octadecylate, calcium phenyl stearate, nickel dibutyl dithiocarbamate, nickel p amyl xanthate, barium dioctyl dithiophosphate, zinc methyl cyclohexyl dithiophosphate, calcium dihexadecyl monothiophosphite, calcium cetyl phosphate, barium mahogany sulphonates, zinc diisopropyl salicylate, tin naphthenate, aluminium naphthenate, magnesium mahogany sulphonates, calcium double salt of octadecyl phenol sulphonic acid, barium phenate-zinc sulphonate of isohexadecyl phenol sulphonic acid, barium di-tert.-amyl phenol sulphide and calcium phenate-barium carboxylate of octadecyl salicylic acid. In examples, mineral lubricating oil compositions are described which contain (i) the reaction product obtained by treating, with P2S5 and also if desired with sulphur, a barium salt of p-tert.-octyl phenol prepared if desired in the presence of stearyl alcohol, (ii) the reaction product obtained by treating with P2S5 or P4S7 a barium salt of 2, 4-di-tert.-amyl phenol prepared in the presence of stearyl alcohol, (iii) the reaction product obtained by treating with P2S5 the barium salt of phenol prepared by alkylating ordinary phenol with refinery butene polymers and (iv) calcium, barium or zinc mahogany sulphonates in addition to the sulphurized phosphorized compounds. Details of tests are given in which mineral lubricating oil compositions containing the sulphurized phosphorized compounds are compared with mineral lubricating oil compositions containing the corresponding unsulphurized unphosphorized metal phenates.ALSO:Additives for petroleum hydrocarbon products are prepared by reacting sulphur and phosphorus, or a phosphorus sulphide with or without either or both of sulphur and phosphorus, with a compound having the formula ArXMT where Ar is an aromatic or substituted aromatic nucleus, X is a non-metal of Group 6 of the periodic table, M is a divalent metal of Group 2 of the periodic table and T is OH or (OM)nXAr where n is 0, 1 or 2. The aromatic nucleus may be benzene, biphenyl, naphthalene or anthracene and may contain substituents such as alkyl, aryl, carboxyl, hydroxyl, alkoxy, sulpphydryl, nitro, esterified carboxyl, keto, amino, aldehydo, chlormethyl, aminomethyl, alkyl thiomethyl, alkyl xanthomethyl, metal substituted carboxyl, metal substituted hydroxyl or sulphhydryl groups or the halogens. Thus the compound to be phosphorized and sulphurized may have the formula R Ar XMT where R represents at least one alkyl group joined to the nucleus Ar, the sum total of carbon atoms in such groups being at least 5 and T being in this case OH or (OM)nX Ar R. In reacting the aromatic compound with sulphur and phosphorus, it may be treated first with one element and then with the other. The sulphurizing phosphorizing reaction may be effected by fusion. Other substances which may be present however during the reaction are solvents, particularly high boiling hydrocarbon solvents such as xylol or a petroleum fraction, higher alcohol anti-foaming agents such as stearyl, lauryl, cetyl or woolfat alcohol and olefinic materials such as tetraisobutylene, cracked gas or an unsaturated alcohol. Preferred compounds for sulphurisation and phosphorization are the metal phenates of alkylated phenols. Suitable alkylated phenols may be prepared by alkylating phenol, cresol, naphthol or other phenolic compounds with such alkylating agents as alcohols, alkyl halides, alkyl phosphates and olefins with the aid of alkylation catalysts such as metal halides, hydrochloric acid, hydrofluoric acid, sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid or activated clay. Conveniently, olefinic material such as petroleum refinery gases, containing mixtures of olefins, may be used as the alkylating agent, or individual olefins may be employed, such as butene, amylene or an olefin polymer such as diisobutylene or triisobutylene. Other suitable alkylated phenols are those prepared by condensing phenols with chlorinated petrolatum or chlorinated paraffin wax or with a chlorinated kerosene or gas oil. Halogenated or nitrated phenols are also suitable as are naturally occurring phenols such as those obtained by alkaline extraction of certain petroleum stocks or those obtained from cashew nut shell liquid or from other vegetable sources. For converting the phenolic materials to metal phenates, the sodium or potassium salts may first be formed by reaction of the phenolic materials with sodium or potassium hydroxide and those salts then converted to the desired divalent metal salts by double decomposition. Alternatively, the alkylated phenol may be reacted directly with the alcoholate, oxide or hydroxide of the desired metal. Specific substances suitable for sulphurization and phosphorization are barium or calcium tertiary octyl phenate, barium diamyl phenate, barium cetyl phenate, zinc isohexadecyl phenate, calcium salt of petroleum phenols, barium salt of wax-alkylated phenol, magnesium salt of octadecyl cresol and the barium phenate-zinc carboxylate of lauryl salicylic acid. In examples: (i) diisobutylene is prepared by polymerising isobutylene in presence of sulphuric acid and the diisobutylene is used to alkylate phenol in the presence of tin chloride and hydrogen chloride; the p-tert.-octyl phenol thus obtained is then reacted with barium hydroxide in presence of mineral lubricating oil and, if desired, stearyl alcohol; the barium phenate solution thus obtained is treated with P2S5 and also, if desired, with sulphur; (ii) 2,4-di-tert.-amyl phenol is reacted with barium hydroxide in presence of mineral lubricating oil and stearyl alcohol and the barium phenate solution thus obtained is treated with P2S5 or P4S7, and (iii) phenol is akylated with refinery butene polymers in the presence of aluminium chloride and hydrogen chloride; the alkylated phenol thus obtained is converted to the corresponding barium phenate by reaction with barium hydroxide in presence of mi"

[Class 83 (iii)] [Also in Group XXIII] A lathe, grinding- machine, or like machine tool having electro-mechanical control means for disengaging the feed motions and means by which the rate of feed is reduced prior to the disengagement, is characterized in that a switch, Fig. 6, attached either to the saddle or the bed, closes the circuit to electrical feed controlling and shifting mechanism when the tool reaches the end of a cutting operation, the switch consisting of a pair of contact points a, alpha<1>. urged into contact with one another by a light spring # and controlled by the movement of a long pivoted lever having a stronger spring # acting oppositely to the other spring ; the short arm of the lever carries a hardened piece #, pressure on which closes the switch ; a second pair of contact points p, p<1> being in circuit with the means for controlling the change from fast to slow speed drive arranged similarly to the other contact points, and utilizing the same lever arm, but adjusted to come into operation earlier than these. Pressure on the piece e is provided by a rod # secured to a micrometer Á clamped to a bracket provided on the bed or saddle of the machine according to which of these members the switch is secured. Closing of the contacts p, p<1> operates an electromagnet P, Fig. 7, which releases a trip N from a spring- controlled lever K. This lever is linked to a further lever L, connected to a pivoted arm C, which carries on the shaft T a wheel B -of the feed train. The lever movement disengages the wheel B from the normal feed drive wheel F and throws it into engagement with a very fine ratchet-feed wheel H. With fine feed now engaged, after a small further movement of a saddle or cross slide, the contacts alpha, alpha<1> of the switch are closed and an electro-mechanical relay is set in motion, Fig. 1, the shaft J of which carries an arm and a chain which rolls on the sleeve J<1 >to exert a pull on one or more flexible wire transmission members X. The pull may be transmitted to a disengaging device, Fig. 2, of a half nut, to stop the feed motion, or to a belt-shifter to stop the whole machine. These devices are fitted with cut-out switches V so that after operation the main circuit may still be ready to operate for any other feed movements. For setting up the switch operating stops visual or audible means may be included in the control circuits and also the circuits may be so arranged that the contact of tool and work stops the machine. Specification 345,325, [Group XXIV], which describes the electro-mechanical relay device, is referred to."

[Class 84] A squeeze mechanism for a teat cup liner 11 consists of a pair of contact blades 24 each pivoted on a thrust blade 23 hinged to the lower ring of a pair of spaced rings 21, 22. The contact blades are pivoted with their shorter length above the pivot so that they bear progressively on the liner from the upper to the lower end. The squeeze mechanism is housed between the liner and the cup housing 14 and is preferably a separate unit but may be integral with the liner or a secondary sheath 12 which if employed may be separate or as shown moulded integrally with the liner and capping 13. The bottom of the liner is secured to a tension tube 15, the tension being adjusted by a nut 16 to which a flexible flow tube 17 is connected so that a constant vacuum may be applied by a vacuum pump. An integral valve housing 30 is provided connected at the bottom to a pulsator tube 31. The valve consists of a plunger 32 reciprocating in a barrel 33 open at the upper end and having at its lower end a jet chamber 34 housing a spring-loaded tapered jet needle 40 on a collar 41 apertured at 42 and screwed into a sleeve 45 having a push fit into the barrel 33. A port 43 and apertures 42 together with ports 36, 46 provide communication with the inner chambers. Ports 35, 36 communicate with the compartment be tween the housing 14 and the secondary sheath 12 so that with the spring-loaded plunger 32 at the top of its stroke the upper port 35 is closed by the plunger wall and the lower port 36 is open to the jet chamber via port 46. On applying vacuum to the jet chamber the plunger descends and covers the port 36 thus sealing the compartment between the housing and the secondary sheath from the vacuum. Further descent uncovers the port 35 to atmospheric pressure which operates the squeeze mechanism. After completion of the vacuum cycle the plunger returns to its original position under the action of its spring 47. In a modification, Fig. 1 (not shown), the valve housing 30 is replaced by connector tubes 18, 19 formed integrally with the housing to which flexible pulsator vacuum tubes 25, 26 are connected to a two-stage pulsator, tube 25 providing the actuation for the compartment between the outer housing and the secondary sheath and tube 26 that for the compartment containing the squeeze mechanism."

715,1593512,20974003,"Cyanobenzylamines are prepared by the hydrogenation of phthalonitrile, isophthalonitrile, and/or terephthalonitrile in the liquid phase in the presence of a palladium or platinum catalyst. The catalysts are preferably deposited on a support such as alumina or carbon. A preferred catalyst is made by depositing 0.1 to 5 parts of palladium on to 99.9-95 parts of powdered alumina. The amount of catalyst used is preferably from 0.005 and 5 per cent by weight of the dinitrile solution. A solvent such as ammonia, toluene or isopropylbenzene, which may be diluted with e.g. ethanol may be used. Suitable amounts of ammonia are up to twenty times the weight of dinitrile, and the ammonia may be used together with e.g. toluene. The reaction may take place between 0 DEG and 150 DEG C. at atmospheric to 100 atmospheres pressure. When temperatures above about 60 DEG C. are used the reaction should be stopped when sufficient hydrogen has been taken up to form the mono-amine. The cyanobenzylamine produced may be recovered e.g. by distillation to remove ammonia and solvents present, followed by vacuum distillation of the residue, or by formation of the hydrates by dissolving the residue in water above the m.p. of the hydrates. The reaction is preferably carried out so that substantially no dinitrile remains at the end of the reaction. Examples are given of the preparation of 4-cyanobenzylamine, and bis-(4-cyanobenzyl) amine from terephthalonitrile, and 3-cyanobenzylamine from isophthalonitrile. 4-Cyanobenzylamine may be converted to the perchlorate with perchloric acid."

717,1593515,20974246,"Thyroxine is obtained from di-iodotyrosine by incubating in an alkaline solution having a pH of approximately 8.5 to 11 with agitation so as to incorporate air or oxygen therein, at about 60 DEG C., preferably in the presence of an oxide of manganese as catalyst and extracting the thyroxine from the mixture. Experiments to determine the most desirable medium for the conversion indicate the use of sodium hydroxide, e.g. N/10, so long as the pH of the incubating solution is held between 8.5 and 11. Sodium carbonate may also be used as the alkaline medium. Further experiments show that the aeration of the solutions is essential for the formation of appreciable amounts of thyroxine, whilst the use of manganese oxides as catalyst results in an increased yield. The thyroxine formed during the incubation period may be protected by the use of n-butyl alcohol and extracted by conventional methods. Specification 598,679 is referred to."

Testing cans.- Air or gas under pressure is admitted to two chambers, which are separated by a flexible diaphragm, and one of which communicates with a can under test. Leakage from the can and consequent movement of the diaphragm causes the can to be automatically rejected. The cans Y, Fig. 1, are fed from a runway d into pockets e attached to a revolving disk E, and are automatically clamped against the pressure cylinders J, which are also attached to the disk by long bolts H, a tight joint between the can and cylinder being produced by rubber rings X, Fig. 4. Compressed air is admitted to the two chambers U, U' through a valve Q from a flexible tube P and a chamber 0, which revolves with the disk and is connected by a stuffing-box to a fixed supply pipe 0<1>. The valve Q is opened and closed by means of a fixed cam b, which acts upon a ball a' on the end of an arm a attached to the valve-plug Q'. The valve is designed to open the port Q<4> before the other port. Leakage from the can as the disk revolves causes the diaphragm Z by means of a rod Z' to open a valve Z<2> and allow the compressed air to force out a stud V<1> to a distance limited by a pin V<2> moving in a slot in an extension V of the cylinder J. The stud V<1> when thus projecting rocks a lever r, against the resistance of a spring r<4>, and by means of a link r<1> lowers a pivoted plate n, allowing the can when unclamped to fall on to the runway for leaky cans. The plate n normally forms part of a runway p for sound cans. The pin V<1> is sufficiently loose to allow the compressed air to escape slowly. The cans Y are clamped against the packing-rings X by means of disks m<1>, actuated by means of cam-rollers h and a camgroove N' in a fixed disk N, Figs. 1 and 2. Each cam-roller h is attached to a slidej, connected by a pin and slot to the disk E and by a link L to links L<1>. L<2>. The link L<1> is pivoted to a sliding rod carrying the disk m<1>, and the link L<2> to lugs K<1> on a bar K secured at each end by nuts to one of the bolts H. The can is released, as seen from the shape of the cam-groove, Fig. 1, after the corresponding pin V<1> has passed the lever r.

The saccha- rine liquid is defecated, clarified, and filtered in the usual way. Sugar is then added to it, while at a temperature of from 190‹ to 195‹ F , until the point of saturation is reached. The liquid is then run off and cooled. In treating molasses for the extraction of sugar, it is first reduced by the addition of hot water, or hot sugar-liquor, to a density of 20‹ BÚ. Sugar is then added to increase the density to from 27‹ to 30‹ Be. The liquor is then clarified, and, if necessary, treated with charcoal, after which sugar is obtained by the saturation process described above."

Conveyers. - Re- lates to an arrange- ment of conveyers used in connection with evaporating- pans to remove crystals formed at the surface of the liquid. The crystals fall upon a conveyer f, Fig. 1, built up of slats of wood or metal g, Fig. 2, attached to a chain f, or con- sisting of a band of flexible material. When slats of wood &c. are used, the conveyer passes round a triangular pulley at each end, but, otherwise, round pulleys are used. The crystals fall off at one end upon a transverse conveyer n which rises out of the pan at one side and carries the crystals to the drying sheds. A fixed inclined block r', Fig. 6, is bent up and round at each side forming a channel in which the ends of the chain pivots r run when the chain is rising out of the liquid. A pulley s under the frame r' holds the parts of the chain separate. Deflecting sheds or pieces con- sisting of inclined boards held over the longitudinal openings between two parallel conveyers are pro- vided. The longitudinal conveyer f, Fig. 2, is driven by a shaft i from a main shaft carrying a worm in gear with the wheel j. The transverse conveyer n is driven by a shaft o carrying a wheel p in gear with a wheel q on the main shaft. This conveyer is provided with fixed shields at each side at the part under the liquid in order to prevent the crystals from being swept off by currents."

Cutting sugar cane, roots, fruit, and food for animals.-In the exiraction of the juice from sugar cane or sorghum, the cane &c. is cut into small pieces by the inclined saws c, c', &c., Fig. 3, on the shaft A of the machine shown in Figs. 1 and 3. The saws are held firmly upon the shaft A by wooden blocks C, C<1>, &c. placed between them ; the saws and blocks are bound together between two washers, one of which bears against a collar on the shaft A and the other against a nut on a screwed portion of the sbaft. The saws overlap each other as shown in Fig. 3, so that they may still act on every portion of the cane &c. after being worn and reset. The teeth only of the saws project from the wooden blocks C, C<1>, &c. The cane &c. passes down an incline T, Fig. 1, into a hollow hopper T', from which it passes under the semi-cylindrical cap Q. The cap Q turns on a hinge G, and the incline T may be moved towards or away from it as well as lifted or lowered to varying inclinations. The hopper T' may be partitioned internally. The pulp produced by the action of the saw-teeth is received by a wagon underneath. The machine may be used for re- ducing sugar cane, sorghum, and maize to fine particles for preparing food for animals, or for reducing coco-nuts and other fruits to pulp, or for extracting starch from tapioca and other roots."

Sugar-cane mills; purifying saccharine liquids.- Instead of driving the rollers A, B, C, Fig. 13, of a cane mill by spur gearing, worm gearing is applied to the side rollers B, C, the third roller A being driven by friction or by spur gearing. The worm shaft is driven by engines or other motor, the end thrust being taken up by the thrust-block P. In a modification, skew-worm gearing is employed so that larger gear-wheels D, D<1> may be used, as they then overlap each other. An end thrust-plate running on friction-rollers may in this case be used in combination with the block P to take up the thrust. The expressed juice from the mill runs down upon a travelling band L, Fig. 14, of wire gauze, through which it passes into a tank, leav- ing any small particles of trash upon the band, from which they are afterwards removed by a revolving brush O. The rollers K, K carrying the band are driven from the mill. The side rolls of the mill are adjusted towards or from each other by simultaneously moving both bearings of either roll. To effect this a side-shaft parallel to the rolls carries n worm at each end which engages with a worm-wheel on the nuts or bolts of the bearings, and on turning the hand-wheel of the side-shaft the corresponding roll is set up or released. Bevel- wheels on the bolts and side-shaft may be employed for the same purpose. Small shafts E, Fig. 21, placed one at each bearing, may be rotated from the side-shaft A by spur-wheels C, D, and thus draw up the wedge-block H against the brass M of the bearing in order to set up the roll B. A similar arrangement, omitting the small shafts E and spur gearing, may be applied to the trash turner, or springs may be interposed between the latter and the mill cheeks, so that, when the side rolls are withdrawn, the springs expand and cause the trash turner to fall, and vice versÔ. In the Provisional Specification it is stated that the clarifier is made of plates with a hollow bottom covered on the inside with copper. The vessel is heated by steam introduced under this copper bottom."

On leaving these rolls, the trash passes along the table F to the conveyer A<2>, by which it is conveyed away. The various rolls are driven by gearing from the prime mover as usual. The rolls are arranged so to be adjustable, and the crushed cane, as it passes along the tables D', D<2>, is kept from rising by the cast-iron rollers P. The sprinklers E', E<2> consist of V-shaped troughs, one side of which is perforated with a number of fine vertical slits through which the water flows. The invention may be applied to ordinary three-roll crushing- mills. In this case the cane is fed between the top and lower front rollers by a travelling table, and passes by an intermediate table between the top and lower back rollers, thus being crushed a second time ; it then passes along a table, where it is wetted with water, and between a pair of supplementary rolls, and is conveyed away by a travelling table. Additional supplementary rollers and sprinklers may be employed. Instead of the stationary table between the ordinary mill and the auxiliary rolls, a movable table may be used."

Beef fat is treated in wooden vats. When treating mutton or similar fats, the vats may be lined inside with tin sheet, or are made of tinned copper. Distilled water is added, and is heated by steam circulating through coils in the vats, or by means of jackets or outside circulation. The copper vats may be heated by a furnace. Solutions of sodium, potassium, ammonium, aluminium, &c. sesqui- or bi-carbonate and sodium, potassium, magnesium, aluminium, &c. chloride are added to the distilled water and fats, and the whole is boiled. The coagulated albumen which rises to the surface is carefully skimmed off. Distilled water is added two or three times during the operation, and the melted fat, after resting two or three hours, is passed into the refrigerators, and thence poured into casks or packages. Fresh meat or other animal or vegetable substance, from which the air and water have been sufficiently expelled by partial cooking, are coated with these fats while in a warm and liquid state. The meat &c. to be preserved is placed in a receptacle, and the fat poured over it. The fat may be mixed by kneading with pea, bean, lentil, or other flour, fecula, or farinaceous substance, the necessary spices, salt, and seasoning being added. The whole is pressed into a vessel &c., and forms a food suitable for armies, navies, and colleges. A soup may be prepared in a concrete and dry state by mixing the fats with dry powdered meat or fresh vegetables reduced to a pulp, from which the water has been extracted by pressure or evaporation.

The pulp is separated into layers by partitions of wickerwork &c. or by mats, and the woollen lining is turned over upon the uppermost parti- tion. The table of tha press ascends, and a piston fixed to the head of the press then enters the vessel and compresses the solid matter into a cake, the liquid being forced out through the per- forations in the walls. The table is then lowered slightly, the vessel being held upon the piston so that latches attached to the vessel may fall and prevent the table, when it rises again, from closing the bottom of the vessel. When the table is raised for the second time, the piston completely enters the vessel and expels the cake of solid matter."

After leaving the belt, the leaves are placed on tables I, which are raised against the belt and slowly rotated by hand, or by a cord and pulleys, to give the proper curl or twist. The tables are raised by acting on treadles k, and they may sometimes be mounted on framings separate from that of the rest of the apparatus. In a machine for giving the compound actions of longi- tudinal and transverse curling, the leaves are carried along on an endless band beneath another endless band, inclined thereto and travelling in the opposite direction ; or the bands may move in the same direction but at different speeds.

Smoke and noxious gases and vapours, consuming.- Furnaces for evaporating and incinerating alkaline lyes, molasses, or other waste liquors from paper- making, potash, animal-black, wool-washing or other works, are constructed so as to consume the smoke and offensive gases. This is effected by mixing the gases with an excess of oxygen without lowering their temperature. The fire gases are led over the evaporating pans and the incinerating beds, air being admitted to them through holes in the cast-iron furnace doors ; the gases pass from the beds to a divided smoke-consuming chamber or flue in which firebricks or fire-brick columns are arranged so as to baffle the gases and mix them closely with the excess of air, thus ensuring the complete combustion of the ' hydrogenated and ' carbonated components of the smoke.' The high temperature maintained in this chamber by the combustion that goes on within it owing to regulated admission of heated air, and the thorough mixtures of gases therein, effect destruction of noxious effluvia and economizes the heat of the furnace. The system is shown as adapted to a ' Porion ' furnace ; in the top Figure, a vertical arrangement of the divided combustion chamber or double flue a fitted with baffles b is provided, while in the lower Figure, a horizontal arrange- ment of double flues placed above the incinerating chamber and fitted with baffles b is provided.

Liquids, treating with; gases, treating with.- Cotton, flax, china-grass, ramie, and other textile fabrics, and other materials are subjected to an oxidizing-process, by the application of certain chemical agents, in order to increase the facility with which they receive colours in dyeing and printing processes. The substances used may be chloride of lime or other bypochlorites, the un- stable chlorine compounds resulting from the decomposition of hydrochloric acid, or chromic acid, permanganic acid, oxygenated water or sub- stances from which oxygen can be generated, ozone, or atmospheric air, etc.; or simple exposure to light may be employed. As an example in which chloric acid is used for treating cotton, potassium or other chlorate is dissolved in water and hydrochloric acid and vanadium (in the form of hypovanadic chloride) are added. The cotton, in the form of fabric &c., is immersed in the bath and then wrung out and heated. In employing chromic acid, the bath is prepared by adding sulphuric or hydrochloric acid to a saturated solution of potassium bichromate. The oxidized material or 'oxycellulose' produced by these means is washed and, if necessary, purified in acid baths ; it readily absorbs methylene blue, the violets of methylaniline, fuchsine, saffranine, aniline greens, phosphine, aniline browns, and other colouring-matters of a basic nature, as well as metallic oxides (protoxides, sesquioxides, and binoxides) even when combined with energetic acids. The two descriptions of colouring-baths and of metallic solutions may also be combined. The baths may be applied by steeping, passage through troughs, pulling or passage between en- graved rollers, or by impression, a thickener such as gum tragacanth being employed in the last case. In operating by impression, one of the chemical agents used may be applied uniformly to the tissue, the other being afterwards applied by im- pression. Thus, cotton fabric may be first treated with a cold solution of potassium bichromate and then dried, the fabric being then printed with a mixture of starch and oxalic acid, dried, washed, &c."

820,1600374,23595178,"3902. Sayers, J., and Salt, G. Feb. 17. Staff, tablet, and ticket systems.-The instruments at both ends of the single-line section are normally unlocked, but the slightest movement of one slide automatically locks the other; further movement holds up its own lock, and then operates mechanical and electrical devices which prevent return before a tablet is removed, and open the locking-circuits so that, when the slide is returned, both instruments are locked until the tablet is returned to one of the instruments. Locking-magnets P govern locks C which engage in recesses D in the slides S which withdraw tablets V from recesses U. The circuit of the magnet P' in station B is from battery 1<a>, through lead 11, contact 2<1>, lead 12', contact 7<1>, lead 13<1>, magnet P', lead 15<1>, contact 9<1>, lead 16', contact 10, lead 17, contact 6, lead 18, and contact 1 back to the battery. A similar circuit controls the magnet P in station A. The first movement of the slide at A breaks contact 1 in the circuit of the magnet P' and makes contact 2 by means of the block X, thus closing the circuit and releasing the lock C. The slide at B is thus locked, and on further movement of the slide at A the lever T rises behind the bottom tablet before the pin p on the lever E passes off the teeth of a catch F, thus preventing backward movement. Before the tablet can be removed, a projection J actuates a lever K and releases a lever H from a catch L, thus allowing this lever to rise and break contacts 5, 6, and 7 and make contacts 3, 4. Both lock circuits are thus broken at contacts 6, 7. On the removal of the tablet, a weight W or a spring returns the slide. The slide remains locked until the tablet is returned into one of the shoots N on which a lever M is operated to open contacts 9, 10 and to close contact 8 momentarily, thus completing the circuit of the magnet G through battery 19 and contact 3. This magnet then attracts its armature and returns the lever H to normal, thus re-closing contacts 5, 6, 7. The lever L is made inoperative on the return stroke. A tooth F<2> on the rack F prevents the withdrawal of the slide after a partial return when a tablet is inserted when the slide is out. Contacts 4, 5 govern the circuits of indicators I and batteries Z, so that, when instruments are at normal, no current flows, but if a tablet is taken from A and contact 4 is closed, current flows through both indicators to show that a tablet is out."

Dynamos and motors combined for transmitting power.-To ensure that each position of the voltage - controlling lever of a dynamo corresponds to a fixed valve of the terminal voltage independently of the load, and in the Leonard or Ilgner system to a fixed speed of a motor supplied from the dynamo, the field-magnet winding w, Fig. 2, of the dynamo g is connected in series with an auxiliary generator h, the current in the field winding eh of which is varied by the said voltage-controlling lever r. The machine h may be coupled mechanically to the machine g; or it may be driven by a constant-speed motor. On exciting the machine h, the terminal voltage of the machine g rises to a value equal to the electromotive force of the machine h minus the drop due to current in the field circuit. To compensate for the varying armature reaction of the dynamo g and for differences in remanent magnetism, a compounding field winding c may be added to the machine h. The size and output of this may be decreased if the dynamo g is provided with an additional self-excited or separately-excited field winding, which may have a resistance in circuit controlled by the lever r. As shown in Fig. 3, the additional field winding e<g> may be connected in series with e<h> and r; if the lightload characteristic curves connecting armaturevoltage and field ampere-turns of the machines g, h are similar at their respective speeds, only a very small current flows through the winding w."

The train carries two stop or signal levers 7n, n linked to vertical bars f, g, respectively, which rise, as shown for the bar g, when plungers h pass into perforations. In rising, the bar lifts the stop-lever m, n, so that the track contact p engages the arm n. This merely lifts the bar g sufficiently to free the band b from the plunger h, and the band is then moved by a spring until one or other of the plungers h snaps into the next hole. If the contact p engages the stop-lever that is not raised, it engages the arm m, which is then given a movement sufficient, in addition to releasing the band. to operate the brake-rod u. A lever 1, 2, 3, Fig. 6, may be fixed to the front of a locomotive and be held in one of two alternative positions by the perforated band. If a train approaches points which are wrongly set, the arm 3 engages a pin 7 and, by it, moves the points over.

Electrical s y s t e m s, automatic.-In signalling-systems in which the track rails are divided into insulated sections, the track relays are polarized and are connected to the rails on each side of the insulating - material, and the insulated rail-sections are joined diagonally by resistances. In the case of long sections, the track battery is connected across the rails at the middle of the block, and two relays are employed, one at each end of the block, to control the signal for that block.

862,1600422,20976554,"3985. Morrison, A. Feb. 17. Bottling. - Relates to a capstantype rotary bottling machine in which each filling- head comprises a snift - chamber of the spring - operated plunger type and a supplycontrol valve consisting of a spring - pressed plunger initially cam - operated to compress the spring, and subsequently released from the cam and maintained in open position by the pressure in the bottle. If the bottle breaks, the valve closes and cuts off the supply. The machine is primarily intended for filling Codd's bottles. The bottle-holders n, of known type, are mounted on pivots s, and are depressed against the action of springs x and locked in the depressed position until filling is complete, whereupon the holders rise, as indicated by the arrow-and-chain lines in Fig. 1. As each holder rises, a relief valve is operated in known manner to reduce the pressure in the snift-chamber and filling-head as the bottle becomes downwardly inclined so that the ball stopper seats itself. Each of the pivots s of the bottle-holders carries at one end the snift - chamber 11 and at the other the supply-control valve fitting 10. The snift-chamber oscillates with the pivot, but the pivot turns in the upper part of the fitting 10, Fig. 7, which is stationary and communicates at 12 with the supply passage and inlet valve d. The supply - control valve c is formed at the upper end of the spring - pressed plunger 13. The valves d, e are positively operated by cams b, c respectively, Figs. 1 and 7, but whereas the cam b holds the valve d open until the revolution of the machine is nearly completed, the cam c releases the valve e after a short time, as explained above. The mode of operating the control-valve plunger is stated to be a development of the method described in Specification 4051/08 for operating the plunger of a sniftchamber, and in addition the plunger of the present snift-chamber may also be operated as described in that Specification."
863,1600423,20976555,"3986. Boult, A. J., [United Shoe Machinery Co.]. Feb. 17. Bevelling, skiving, etc.; channelling, grooving, &c.-In machines for channelling soles of boots and shoes, having a cutter and an end gauge, both reciprocating in the direction of feed, the gauge and the sole are caused to move apart automatically during the return or cutting-stroke. Fig. 4 shows a part of a machine in which the channel-knife 12, the edge or shoulder knife 14, and the slides 82, 90 carying the edge gauge 80 are arranged and operated substantially as described in Specification 13,052/08. In the construction shown in Fig. 4, the edge gauge 80 is caused to recede from the sole on the cutting-stroke. This is effected by arranging the dovetail connexion 104 between the slides 82, 90 at an angle with the line in which the cutters reciprocate. In order that the work table 2 may be adjusted with the lower slide 82, a tongue on the table engages with a groove in an adjustable block 102 secured to the slide 82. As this is normally stationary, there is no wear in the tongue-and-groove connexion as occurs in the construction described in Specification 19,214/09, in which the groove is formed in a block secured to the reciprocating slide 90. The gauge 80 is provided with a vertical adjustment on its shank, so that wear between it and the work-table can be taken up. This is necessary because stock placed in temper tends to crowd itself into any interstice caused by wear and retards the feeding of the stock. The work-retaining or pressure foot that holds the work stationary during the cutting stroke extends wholly across the cutting-edge of the shoulder knife, to prevent the force due to cutting from forcing the stock out of position. In order to obviate upward movement of the gauge due to wear in the slides 82, 90, the shank 98, Fig. 7, of the gauge carries a projecting split boss 108, in which the shank of a plate 114 is clamped by a screw 110. This plate bears against the under surface of the table 2, and thus prevents the gauge from rising. The shank of the plate 114 contains an oiled-wick lubricator 116. According to modifications shown in Figs. 9 and 13, the edge gauge moves parallel to the cutters, as described in Specification 13,052/08, but forces the work and the work-retainer to move across the line of feed during the cutting-stroke when the shank of the sole is being operated upon. This is permitted by a sliding connexion 150, Fig. 13, between the presser-foot 62b and its carrier, in which case the presser-foot is returned to its normal position by a leaf-spring 152, or by mounting its carrier 128, Fig. 9, in a yoke 133 pivoted at 132 to the vertically-reciprocating slide 131. The carrier 128 is guided in its swinging movement in a guide 130, which contains a spring 146 to return the carrier to its normal position.

887,1605483,20976592,"4936. Rousset, F. Rossbach-. March 19, 1910, [Convention date]. Valves controlled from a distance.-In apparatus for controlling the valves of gas burners by means of mechanism operated by a yielding pressure member, a gas chamber 11, separated from a chamber 10 by a diaphragm 9, is temporarily placed in communication with the atmosphere by an outlet valve 18, controlled by the diaphragm, each time the burner valve 1 is operated. The gas enters at 7 and passes through the chamber 5 and passage 15 to outlets 12, 13 leading respectively to chambers 10, 11. The throttling-screws 16, 17 are so adjusted that a difference of pressure only exists in the chambers 10, 11 when a rapid and definite rise of gas pressure takes place. When this occurs, the increase of pressure in the chamber 11 acts on the diaphragm to lift a lever 27 and pawl 25 to open the outlet valve 18. By this means, the pressure in the chamber 11 is reduced, and the diaphragm readily moves into its fully-extended position. The head 34 of the rod 32 then rotates the ratchet wheel 41 through levers 35, 38, 40, and operates the burner and pilot valves 1, 3. Owing to the springiness of the lever 35, the diaphragm is able to make a further stroke, by means of which the cam-face 28 of the pawl 25 contacts with the inclined surface 29 and releases the valve 18, which at once closes under the action of the spring 21. The gas pressure in the chambers 10, 11 is then gradually equalized, and the parts return to the normal positions. For quickly returning the diaphragm, a construction is described in which a valve in the chamber 11 establishes communication with the supply-pipe 7 after the burner valve has been operated."

The ploughs 21 are proportionately shifted away from the side to which they deliver so that those on that side have less leverage than those on the other side. The motor drives the wheels 14 through differential gearing 12 and a countershaft 13. One of the wheels 14 is adjustable in a curved guide 15.

The free end of the lever is provided with arms 11, 16, and is controlled by two tension springs 12, 13, of which the spring 12 is slightly the stronger, its tension being adjustable by means of a screw 14 and nut 15. The lever is adapted either to break contact with a terminal plate 18, or to make contact with a terminal 6. In the event of the wire 8 being broken, the spring 12 turns the lever 4 over sideways, as shown in dotted lines in Fig. 2, and the lever remains in contact with a vertical extension 18<a> of the terminal plate 18 and misses the contact 6, so that an alarm of fire is not given; contact is made, however, with a terminal plate 20 in order to give a local alarm indicating derangement of the apparatus."

Liquid-pressure engines.-In order that the value of available pressure can be altered according to requirements without loss of water, an hydraulic machine comprises a main cylinder 8 and plunger A, and an auxiliary plunger B working in a cylinder 9 connected by a passage 10 to the cylinder 8. Each plunger is con-, nected to an adjustable lever C in such a manner that the effective work of the machine is the difference between the work performed by the plunger A and that performed on the plunger B. When water is admitted through the valve 11 into the cylinder 8, moving the plunger A down, the water passes from the cylinder 9 back to the cylinder 8. The fulcrum 6 of the lever C is adjustable in order that the effective pressure of the machine may be varied. When the fulcrum is at position III, the plunger B is held in place and the effective pressure is that of the plunger A. When in the position IV, the effect of the two cylinders is added. In one modification, the two plungers are connected by cranks which are connected by a coupling-rod, the length of one crank being made adjustable. In another modification, the two pistons are mounted in the same cylinder, each being connected to a lever, one of which has an adjustable fulcrum, the levers being connected by a link. When a number of plungers working in different phases are employed to produce a continuous output of work, it is necessary that at least one plunger must be performing a working stroke, and as it is necessary that the plunger should pause at the end of each stroke, means are provided for accelerating the return stroke of the pistons. In the form shown in Fig. 4, this means comprises springs 15<1>, 15<2> arranged in slides 14', 14<2> the latter being connected to the ends of a two-armed lever 16, so that in the position shown, the plunger A<1> completes its return stroke while the plunger A<2> has a portion of its power stroke corresponding to the compression of the spring to complete. Fig. 5 shows a double-acting engine in which the crank 19 is connected to the connecting-rod through a pin and slot so that the crank has idle movement at the deadcentres, during which time the valves are reversed. Two or more such double - acting cylinders are employed with the cranks in different phases. The cylinders may have separate supply conduits, the water being displaced by the auxiliary plunger being stored in a lowpressure reservoir."

Generating combustion products under pressure. - A cylinder a having a combustion chamber at each end contains a piston c propelled by explosions which take place alternately at each end. During i t s movement, the piston compresses combustion products and air on one side, and draws in air and a combustible on the other side. The cylinder a is in communication with the storage reservoir through valves d, d', chamber e, and pipes f. Combustible is supplied through pipes j, j<1>, chambers m, m<1>, holes l, l<1>, and valves k, k<1>. On the movement of the piston to the right, burnt gases and air are expelled through the valve d<1>, and burnt gases escape past the valve d when it has been uncovered by the piston. This escape takes place until the pressure in the cylinder is equal to that in the reservoir when the valve d closes. Further movement of the piston draws in air which has been caused by casings h to traverse the toothed cylinder ribs i through the valve b and compresses the air and gases in the right end of the cylinder prior to an explosion therein. A similar cycle takes place on the return stroke of the piston. At starting,- compressed-air or an explosion charge may be admitted by cocks o, o<1>."

Electrical systems, non-automatic; track apparatus actuating signals on trains, and for stopping trains.-The circuit from a track generator to a track relay, arranged to be short-circuited by a train on the section, is closed by a relay in a normally-open circuit closed by a train contacting with a track contact, the track relay controlling the circuit through the track contact to the apparatus on the train. The apparatus serves to actuate signals or train-stopping apparatus in any of the following circumstances in spite of failure or error on the part of an operator : -(a) a broken or displaced rail in the section ahead, (b) a train occupying the section ahead, (c) points unsafe, (d) speed excessive for a particular track. Fig. 7 shows a simple arrangement of circuits for one direction of traffic only, namely, from left to right of the Figure. A train on the ramps 1, 2 closes the circuit from battery 370 through the relays 371, each of which completes the circuit from the track batteries 377 to the opposite rails and the track relays 380, the armatures of which, if all sections of track are clear, complete the circuit from the battery 370 over resistance 387 to the track contacts 1, 2. The current in this circuit is sufficient to restrain the operation of the danger signals. Modifications of the circuits and apparatus on the track are described for single and double track working; polarized relays may be used both on the track and train. Manually operated switches 372 are provided for control by a signalman. Points may be fitted with apparatus connected up to a track ramp so that unless the points are home and locked the traincircuits are not energized to restrain a danger signal. Fig. 10 shows a track contact provided with means for protection against damage by hanging chains or couplings. The T-shaped contact bar 506 is bolted to a sleeper 505 supported on chairs 504, the bolts in both cases being covered by metal casings with inclined surfaces. A nose 517 protects the end of the bar 506. An apparatus arranged on the train and provided with means for stopping the train in case of excessive speed at fixed points on the track is shown in Fig. 14. This includes a relay 611 in series with two reversing switches, one, 614, moved bv connexions to reversing gear of the locomotive and the other 616, set by hand for up or down working along the track, and with contacts on a speed-controlled device 618 and contacts engaged by an arm 603 which is swung laterally of the track to a distance D determined by the displacement of the side face of a track contact according to the allowable speed. The circuit to the relay 611 is thus closed only if apparatus on the track and train is in proper order and the speed is not excessive. The relay 611 controls the circuit to the restraining magnets 52, 53 of the signal and stopping apparatus. Modifications of train apparatus include line clear signals and means for unlocking an enclosing cover over means for resetting the signal and brake restraining devices. The said cover is locked by a latch controlled by an electro-magnet energizable from an extension or auxiliary ramp."

Commutator switching arrangements. - In high-tension rectifiers, the points in the alternating current wave between which contact is established are selected by adjustment of the rectifier frame, of the contact members carried by the frame, or of the rectifier-shaft. These adjustments ma.y be made while the rectifier is working. Contact may be made mechanically or by means of sparks or arcs. In the form illustrated in Fig. 1, contact arms 4 having straight contact edges are fixed upon an axially movable shaft and cooperate with arc-shaped contact pieces 5 fitted by insulated pins to the frame of the rectifier and set at an angle to the shaft axis. The contacts 5 are rotatably adjustable on their pins and may be of elastic material so that when turned their curvature may adjust itself or be adjusted to engage the contacts 4 correctly. The frame contacts may be parallel to the axis and the shaft contacts inclined or both sets may be inclined. In an arrangement shown in Fig. 5. radially adjustable point contacts 10 co-operate with trapeziform contacts 9, the shape of which governs the nature of the selective adjustment obtained by the apparatus. In addition to the axial displacement of the shaft, the rectifier frame may be rotated about the shaft. The stator of the synchronous motor used to drive the apparatus may be turned relatively to the rectifier frame or the rotor may be turned relatively to the rectifier shaft. The stator and rectifier frame may be jointly mounted in slide guides so that they may be adjusted axially with relation to the rectifier shaft. In the rectifier shown in Fig. 5, two consuming devices 29 are fed with uni-directional currents pulsating in the same phase, one pole of each circuit being earthed. Another form of rectifier is described in which the frame carries contact plates with curved oblique edges and the shaft point contacts. The frame is adjustable about the axis of the shaft and is also axially movable and has a handle with a securing screw. The following abridgment should be inserted in place in the present volume."

Sights and methods of sighting; ordnance, discharging by means external to breech mechanism. -Fire-control apparatus for a gun mounted on a moving platform such as a ship, comprises a gyroscopically controlled switch, optical means whereby the deviation of the gyroscope may be detected and compensating mechanism for correcting the effect of deviation so that the gun is fired automatically when it makes a predetermined angle with the line of sight on the target. As shown in Fig. 1 and 2, a switch arm 16 co-operating with contact plates 19, 20, is controlled by a gyroscope the rotor casing 1 of which is suspended on a vertical trunnion axis 2 in a gimbal ring 3 which is mounted by horizontal trunnions 4 in the casing 5. The objective 11 and eyepiece 12 of a telescope are fixed to the casing 5 and two reflectors 9, 10, the planes of which are normally vertical and intersect in the trunnion axis 2, are carried by the rotor casing 1. When the ship rolls or pitches the image of the target remains steady, but straying motion of the gyroscope about the horizontal trunnion axis 4 raises or lowers the image. When the gyro strays about the vertical axis 2 it can be brought back to the central position by a torque applied to a head 4a on one of the trunnions 4. When it strays about the horizontal axis it can be restored by striking a light spring 14 projecting from the rotor casing 1 by means of a rotating device having four curved spokes 13. In a modification, Fig. 4, the objective 11 and eye-piece 12 are mounted on a rotatable plate 21, and the switch is mounted on a frame 23 mounted to turn about the trunnion axis 4 and connected by links 24, 25, 26 to the plate 21. When the image moves off the crosswires, due to the straying of the gyro about the trunnion axis 4, it is brought back by turning the plate 21, and this movement turns the frame carrying the switch through an angle equal to the angle of movement of the gyro. In the construction shown in Figs. 9 and 10, the observer faces the target. The optical system includes four reflectors 33 - - - 36, the two vertical ones 33, 34 being stabilized by the gyro. The two transverse reflectors 35, 36 are adjusted by means of a knob 43 to raise or lower the image on the cross-wires to compensate for straying movement of the gyro about the horizontal axis, and the knob also actuates mechanism for correspondingly correcting the angular position of the switch. Other telescopic systems giving an upright image are described, the inverting portion of the system being stabilized by the gyro and the dimensions being chosen so that the image remains stationary on the cross-wires. To deal with the yawing motion of the ship, another switch may be fitted to the same gyroscope, or the whole apparatus may be duplicated. The electric circuit may be so arranged that the gun will not fire unless the yawing contact is already made when the rolling I contact is first made."

Figs. 1 and 2 show the invention applied to a prismatic telescope which is provided with means for annulling the effects of the angular motion of the ship only in the vertical plane, The prisms 9, 10 of the instrument are mounted in a fork 6 at one end of a horizontal shaft 4 mounted by ball bearings in a pedestal 2 and stabilized by a gyroscope 7 mounted in a fork 5 at the other end of the shaft 4. The objective 14 and eyepiece 15 of the telescope are attached to a cylindrical sleeve 16 turning on a casing 17.

An air pump 9 draws air from a tank 12, thus causing water in a tank 1 to rise through a pipe 3, 4 into the casing containing the member 14 into the interior of which air is admitted from a filter 15 through the shaft 16. The air issues through fine holes 17 and meets the water, which is guided by ribs 18, the mixture passing between the vanes and fixed blades 20, 21, 22, 23 to an annular space, from which it passes through an opening 25 through a pipe 6 to the tank 12. The water is drawn off through a filter 27 by suction from the centrifugal pump 33, and passes by the path 28, 29, 7, 33, 8, 38 to a tank 2. The pipe 6 may be constructed as shown in Fig. 2, or may contain balls as shown in Fig. 3, and a chamber 42 may be provided at the lower end into which air is discharged through a porous pot 41.

Jan. 12, 1945, Nos. 1027, 1176 and 1178. [Class 38 (iv)] [Also in Groups XXXVII and XXXVIII] A thermostatic control device which may be used as an inching control for actuating radiator or cooling flaps on aircraft comprises a switch for initiating movement of the controlled device, the switch being actuated by an axially movable element responsive to the movements of a thermally sensitive bellows device mounted in a removable thermal head unit and a cam movable with the controlled element and adapted to open the switch. The removable thermal head unit may be interchanged with another unit containing a different number or arrangement of bellows. Figs. 2 and 3 show sectional elevations of a device for controlling a flap &c. for regulating the flow of air through the radiator or cooler of an aircraft engine, the flap being linked to an arm 18 which is thus rotated by movements of the flap. The flap is driven by a reversible motor or jack on the closing of a thermostatically operated switch 11 which is subsequently opened by a lever and cam device 24, 16 actuated by the rotation of the spindle 17 carrying the arm 18. Relay mechanism 2 is interposed between the motor and switch 11. The switch is actuated by two bellows 41 mounted side by side and connected to thermal responsive elements at different parts in the engine cooling &c. system under control. Movement of the bellows is transmitted to the end 9 of a spring-pressed axially movable rod 5 carrying a nut 6 on its other end. Rotation of the rod 5 is prevented by a pin 8 on the latter engaging in a slot in a fixed bush 8b. Axial movement of the rod 5 effects closure of the switch 11 by means of a channel-shaped member 28 pivoted at 27 to a lever 22 and bearing at its lower end against a switch-actuating rod 29. A spring 32 presses a fulcrum on the member 28 against a ring 7 surrounding the rod 5 movement of which thus closes the contacts 11, 13 or 11, 13a to start the flap driving motor rotating in the appropriate direction. The lever 22 is mounted on a spindle 21 and terminates at its lower end in an arm 24 which is spring-pressed against the cam 16, After the switch 11 has been closed to cause the arm 18 and spindle 17 to rotate, the rotation of the cam 16 rocks the lever 22 about its pivot 21 and moves the pivot pin 27 and member 28 thus causing the switch to move to its open position. Variations in the ambient temperature at the thermal head 41 are compensated by forming the arm 24 as a bi-metallic strip which moves the lever 22 in the opposite direction to that of the rod 5 so that the position of the lower end of the arm 24 remains unaltered. The arm 24 may be duplicated by a second strip 24a to increase the rigidity of the device. The bore of the cam 16 is cut at a small angle to the axis of the cam so that the lift applied to the arm 24 may be adjusted either by sliding the cam along its shaft or by moving the arm 24 laterally. As shown in Fig. 2 the rod 5 is controlled by two bellows 41 so that either bellows will continue to exercise control if the other becomes inoperative. Each bellows is provided with a head 45 which is pivoted at 46 to a rocking lever 47 carrying an adjustable abutment 51 which engages a pivoted thrust plate 49. A stud 50 on the plate 49 abuts against the end 9 of the rod 5 and a spring 52 loads the bellows. Fig. 7 shows a modification employing only one thermal head or bellows 83 which is detachably mounted on a plate 37 carried in a casing 36, the bellows being connected by a tube 39 to a phial mounted near the engine cooling system or other point at which the temperature is to be controlled. The end wall 40 of the bellows engages the head 9 of the rod 5 and is dished as shown to reduce the volume of the bellows and to provide a stop for limiting the compression of the bellows. If the thermal element is of the vapour pressure type a second evacuated and spring loaded bellows may be mounted below the bellows 38 and connected thereto to compensate for changes of external pressure. The full range of flap travel may be broken into a number of steps which may be regulated by the provision of a hold-on circuit for the relays and a notched cam movable with the cam 16 and actuating a snap-action switch to break the hold-on circuit intermittently and at predetermined intervals. As shown in Fig. 3 a notched cam 54 is mounted on the shaft 17 and engages a pin 59 on a pivoted. lever 58 carrying a pin 60 which abuts against the actuating pin of the switch arm 55. A further cam 62 may be secured to the shaft 17 to operate a switch 63 for opening the hold-on circuit when the flap approaches either end of its range as described in Specification 601,145. A manually operated override control may be provided comprising a disc or barrel carrying contact strips adjustably secured on the shaft 17 and co-operating with a number of wiper blades so that when the flap is at a position other than the desired pre-set position a circuit will be closed to operate the flap driving means, the wiper blades becoming disengaged from the contact strips to break the circuit when the flap has reached the desired position. Specifications 566,462, [Group XXVII], and 569,955 also are referred to."

[Class 76] Vegetable-tanned leather is rendered less liable to ageing by providing therein after tanning an oxalate of an alkaline earth metal (including magnesium), a water-soluble oxalic acid ester, or oxamide. The leather may first be treated with oxalic acid to convert any iron present into an oxalate complex. By treatment with solution of oxalic, acid or a soluble oxalate, and then with a solution of an alkaline earth salt, the insoluble oxalate is formed in situ. In an example cow hide after deliming is washed with oxalic acid at pH 2.5, adjusted to pH 4.0 with borax, and tanned with mimosa extract in the presence of oxalic acid. The leather is soaked in oxalic acid solution and then in calcium acetate solution. In another example solid potassium oxalate and calcium acetate are drummed into wet leather."

[Also in Group XXXVII] When solenoid 4.13 is energized by an overcurrent trip circuit forming part of a traction system, valve 4.6 is raised and main control valve 4.1 is opened, so as to open arc interrupting contacts within chamber 1.1, 1.2, and apply gas blast thereto. The pressure in duct 2 is also applied to the underside of piston 6.2 whereby piston 5.1 is moved to open isolating contacts 1.7, 1.8. De-energization of the solenoid 4.13 allows the main control valve 4.1 to re-close, followed by re-closure of the interrupting contacts in the chamber 1.1, 1.2. A solenoid 7.15 is energized from a re-setting circuit, whereby valve 7 causes piston 5.2 to return the contact 1.7 into engagement with the contact 1.8, the valve 6 having been returned to its original position upon removal of gas from the duct 2. Solenoid 6.11 is energized when the vehicle passes between parts of a line conductor at different voltages. Such energization raises pistons 6.1, 6.2, so that pressure is applied to piston 5.1 to open isolating contacts 1.7, 1.8. This operation is effected without opening of the main control valve 4 whereby the contacts in the chamber 1.1, 1.2 remain closed and there is no blast discharge from outlet 1.6. After the motor connections have been suitably modified for the new line voltage, solenoid 6.11 is deenergized and solenoid 7.15 is energized to reclose the isolator contacts. Means responsive to the position of the vehicle may be provided for automatically opening and re-closing the contacts 1.7, 1.8, in the manner described. When the solenoid 4.13 is energized to open.the main control valve 4, trip lever 13.5 engages latch bar 13.3 so that the latter is moved clear of roller 13.2. If solenoid 7.15 is energized at this time, in an endeavour to change the motor connections when an over-current condition exists, then lever 7.12 pivots about its connection with rod 7.9 and the valve 7 is not operated. If the solenoid 4.13 is energized whilst the valve 7 is operative, the latch bar will again be tripped from the roller and the valve 7 will return to its non-operative position. The valves 6 and 7 may be interlocked mechanically or otherwise. Instead of interrupting the traction motor circuits, the operating current may be maintained or reduced while the isolator contacts 1.7, 1.8, are opened. The circuitbreaker may be included in the primary circuit of a main transformer for supplying the traction motors. The change to a new line voltage may be effected by opening the motor circuits on the secondary side of the main transformer. Specification 777,543, [Group XXXVII], is referred to."

In an arrangement for storing television signals for a limited period and subsequently ' reading-of such stored signals at a rate which may be the same as or different from, the rate at which the signals are stored, the signals to be stored, derived from terminal 13, are supplied via switch 14 during alternate frame periods, to produce an image on the screen of a picture reproducing tube 10 which image is directed on to the photo-sensitive surface 17 of an image-type tube 18 to produce an electrostatic charge image on the charge storage electrode 20. During these frame periods the circuit from the output resistor 27 to the output terminal 35 via switch 32 is ' open.' During the other alternate frame periods switch 14 changes over and supplies a positive voltage to the control electrode of tube 10 which then operates as a flying spot scanner to ' read ' the stored information and generate corresponding output signals across resistor 27. During these frame periods the circuit to terminal 35 is ' closed ' via switch 32 and the output signals are available at this point. Whilst the ' writing ' and ' reading ' cycles are being effected via the tubes 10 and 18 similar ' reading ' and ' writing cycles respectively are simultaneously effected (controlled by switch 14) in a second identical storage arrangement 34 the output signals developed across resistor 27<SP>1</SP> during the ' reading ' cycles being supplied via switch 32 to terminal 35 alternately with the signals across resistor 27. At the end of the ' reading ' frame period (of each storage arrangement) a negative pulse from generator 31 is supplied, via condenser 36, to an annular electrode 24, which serves to collect secondary electrons liberated by the charge storage electrode 20, and, within the duration of this pulse, a positive pulse is supplied (from generator 31) to a flash tube 28 the light produced by which illuminates the photo-sensitive surface 17 and liberates electrons which are directed on to electrode 20. These primary electrons and secondary electrons released by electrode 20 are then retained by the latter until its potential falls to a value equal to that of electrode 24 after which secondary electrons from 20 are collected by electrode 24 so that 20 is stabilized at a potential equal to that of 24 and thus when the pulse applied to electrode 24 ends electrode 20 is left at a potential below that of electrode 24 which is the requirement for correct operation of tube 18. In addition the application of the negative pulse and the ' flashing ' serve to remove any residual charge pattern on electrode 20."

975,1626710,20983566,"Alkylated monohydroxy phenol sulphides are prepared by alkylating a phenol with an olefine in the presence of a boron halide catalyst, dissolving the reaction product containing the catalyst in an organic solvent and treating the solution with a sulphur halide. In addition to the monohydroxy phenols as starting materials there may also be used high molecular weight alkylated phenols prepared by condensing phenols with chlorinated petrolatum or chlorinated paraffin wax or with a chlorinated kerosene or gas oil. The alkylation is preferably carried out by first adding the boron halide catalyst to the phenol and then introducing the olefine. This is stated to avoid sludge formation. As olefines there may be used individual olefines or mixtures derived from petroleum and refining gases. The preferred catalysts are boron trifluoride and combinations of boron trifluoride with water and with phosphoric acid. For the sulphurization the preferred reagents are sulphur chloride in a petroleum naphtha solvent. An example is included in which tertiaryoctyl phenol is produced by the reaction of diisobutylene on phenol and the product sulphurized with sulphur chloride in a petroleum naphtha solvent."
976,1626711,20983600,"A catalyst comprising nickel chromite, used in the production of hydrocarbons containing more than one carbon atom per molecule from carbon monoxide (see Group IV) and hydrogen, is prepared by adding a solution of ammonium dichromate in water and ammonium hydroxide to an aqueous solution of nickel nitrate maintained at about 165 DEG F., the resultant precipitate being filtered, dried at 300 DEG F. and then calcined at 700 DEG F. Other nickel salts, e.g., the chloride, carbonate and sulphate may be employed. In the latter case any sulphate ions present in the catalyst should be removed. Chromic acid and ammonium hydroxide, ammonium chromate, or sodium and potassium chromates and dichromates may be employed instead of the ammonium dichromate. The nickel chromite may be pelleted or employed on a suitable carrier such as silica gel, alumina gel, diatomaceous earth, kieselguhr, activated charcoal and for this purpose the catalyst may be precipitated within the carrier and the catalyst impregnated carrier then calcined. The nickel chromite may also be coated on the carrier and calcined and reduced as a coating on the carrier. The catalyst either alone or on a porous or gelatinous carrier may be used in fluid operation. In two examples the catalyst employed in the reaction of carbon monoxide with hydrogen is prepared by reducing the nickel chromite obtained as above with a large excess of hydrogen at temperatures of 760 DEG F. and 750 DEG F. respectively. The nickel chromite reduced by hydrogen comprises a catalytic mixture of metallic nickel and chromium.ALSO:Hydrocarbons containing more than one carbon atom per molecule are produced by reacting carbon monoxide and hydrogen at temperatures of 300-450 DEG F. and at atmospheric or elevated pressures in the presence of a catalyst comprising nickel chromite and/or a mixture of metallic nickel and chromium obtained by reducing nickel chromite with hydrogen. The catalyst may be prepared (see Group III) by adding a solution of ammonium dichromate in water and ammonium hydroxide, to an aqueous solution of nickel nitrate and drying and calcining the resultant precipitate. Instead of ammonium dichromate, chromic acid and ammonium hydroxide, ammonium chromate or sodium and potassium chromates and di-chromates may be used. Other nickel salts, e.g. the sulphate, chloride and carbonate may be used, but when nickel sulphate is employed, precautions should be taken to remove any sulphate ions present in the precipitated catalyst. The catalyst may be pelleted or employed on a suitable carrier such as silica gel, alumina gel, diatomaceous earth, kieselguhr and activated charcoal. The nickel chromite may also be coated on the carrier and calcined and reduced as a coating on the carrier. The nickel chromite prepared by calcination of the nickel ammonium chromate complex is suitable for use in fluid operation and the catalyst has been found to fluidize readily when prepared on a carrier such as silica gel, alumina, clay, bauxite, silica-alumina gels and kieselguhr. The feed stock which should be freed from sulphur and sulphur compounds, e.g. by treatment with caustic alkali or tri-ethanolamine, may be supplied from such sources as water gas, gases obtained through the controlled hydrogenation of coal or by gasification of solid carbonaceous fuel such as coke, brown coal and mineral oil, or by the conversion of natural gas, by the reaction of methane with steam and/or carbon dioxide or subjecting hydrocarbon gases to controlled and incomplete combustions. In two examples, the catalyst prepared as above is reduced with a large excess of hydrogen at 760 DEG F. and 750 DEG F. respectively, and a mixture of carbon monoxide and hydrogen passed through a reactor containing the catalyst. The temperature of the reactor is about 360 DEG F. and the throughput is 118 volumes and 111-113 volumes of gaseous synthesis mixture per volume of catalyst per hour respectively, liquid hydrocarbons being obtained."

[Class 37] Equipment for testing whether a high voltage line is live, comprises a detector head mounted on a long insulated pole and arranged to apply voltage to an electric discharge indicating lamp. As shown in Fig. 1, a hook 1 for engagement with a high voltage line is connected through an air gap 2 to one electrode of a discharge lamp 3 and to a terminal plug 4. The other electrode of the lamp 3 is connected to a conducting member 5 and a second terminal plug 6. The parts to the right of the dotted line constitute a checking device comprising a socket 7 engaging the plug 4 and two sockets 8, 9 engaging the plug 6. The sockets 7,. 8, 9 are connected to a transformer 10, battery 11, and vibrator 21. When in use the test equipment is supported on a long insulating pole and the plugs 4, 6 are not connected. Discharge passes from the line across the air gap 2, discharge lamp 3, and the capacity of the member 5 to earth and the lamp glows. The detector head is tested by detaching from the pole and plugging in to the checking device, thereby connecting the sockets 8, 9 together and closing the vibrator circuit. Relatively high voltages are thereby generated, stepped up in the transformer 10, and applied to the electrodes of the lamp 3. The hook 1 is fixed to an insulating block 13, Fig. 2, to which is fixed a metal hood 14 which directs the light from the lamp downwards and forms a part of the conducting member 5. The hood is fixed to a metal tube 15 which fits on to the upper end of an insulating pole 18 and is held by a catch 16 operated by a press button 17 so that the plugs 4, 6 are enclosed. The checking device, Fig. 3, is enclosed in a metal tube 19 having at its upper end a screwed socket to receive a plug 28 at the lower end of the pole 18. The battery 11 consists of two cells held in position by a spring 20. The transformer 10, vibrator 21, and sockets 7, 8 are arranged in the lower end of the tube 19, on which is mounted a rotatable sleeve 25 which normally covers the sockets 7, 8 and a hole 24 which permits adjustment of the vibrator. Alternatively the detector head and checking device may be combined to form a single unit which is fitted to the top of the pole, a switch being provided for connecting the lamp at will to the checking device."

[Class 82 (ii)] In a method of separation of solids of mixed sizes and/or specific weights in a liquid, a mixture of the solids and the liquid is introduced into a confined treatment zone and is subjected to a centrifugal force within the zone, which centrifugal force is applied with increasing effect towards the top of the zone while a retarding force is applied to the outward surface of the zone to induce an upward flow of liquid through the confined zone, creating an inner liquid zone, a central selective zone and an outer zone, the heavier and lighter solids being separated according to their sink- and-float characteristics in the said central selective zone, the heavier solids being discharged from the said outer zone, the lighter solids overflowing from the surface of the body of liquid in the confined treatment zone. The mixture of solids may be fed at the top of the treatment zone in a substantially horizontal direction, and the heavier solids separated therefrom may be discharged through a restricted zone at the bottom of the said treatment zone from which they are elevated to a point of discharge above the liquid surface. Apparatus for carrying out the invention may comprise a tank 9, Figs. 4 and 6, having a discharge outlet 11 for heavier solids and an upper discharge outlet 10 for lighter solids. mixture delivery means 15 adjacent the top of the tank and a massive unperforate rotary impeller 12 extending through substantially the entire depth of the tank, but with its bottom in spaced proximity to the bottom of the tank, the confined treatment zone being defined by the walls of the tank and impeller. The apparatus may include means 14 for varying the speed of the rotary impeller."
996,1626751,20987223,"Fluoroform is prepared by reacting gaseous chloroform with gaseous hydrogen fluoride in the presence of a catalyst consisting of active carbon impregnated with iron chloride, the reaction being carried out at a temperature between 200 DEG and 400 DEG C. The catalyst is preferably activated charcoal which has been impregnated with ferric chloride, and contains about 12 per cent of iron. Fluoroform is separated from the reaction products; and the by-products, viz. fluorodichloromethane and chlorodifluoromethane, are preferably recirculated over the catalyst with fresh chloroform and hydrogen fluoride. A preferred method of operating is to pass a mixture of hydrogen fluoride with chloroform and recirculated fluorodichloromethane and chlorodifluoromethane over the catalyst at a temperature of about 250 DEG C., and then to pass the products over catalyst in a second reaction stage at about 350 DEG C. The gaseous effluent is washed with water to remove hydrogen chloride and hydrogen fluoride; and the residual gases are dried and condensed. The condensate is fractionally distilled to isolate the fluoroform. The fluorodichloromethane and chlorodifluoromethane are returned to the first reaction stage. Specification 428,445, [Group IV], is referred to."
